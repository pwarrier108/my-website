In August 2024, I published *Once Upon a Time in KREC: Mirthful Musings of '81*, a collection of stories from our years at Karnataka Regional Engineering College—now the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK). We were 249 boys and 1 girl who entered KREC in 1977 and emerged four years later as adults, engineers, and lifelong friends.

This book is not a history. It is memory—subjective, humorous, and occasionally embarrassing.

## Why Write This Now?

Forty-three years after graduation, our batch reunited on the NITK campus in July 2024. As we walked through familiar spaces—some unchanged, others transformed—the stories began to surface. Not the sanitized versions we tell at professional gatherings, but the messy, funny, human moments that defined who we became.

I realized these stories deserved documentation. Not because they are exceptional, but because they are honest. They capture what it meant to study engineering at a regional college in India during the late 1970s and early 1980s—a time before the internet, before mobile phones, when distance meant something and community was earned, not clicked.

## What's Inside

The book unfolds through snapshots of KREC life:

**The Early Days:** "KARENG Calling" and "A Messy Beginning" chronicle our introduction to hostel food, questionable hygiene, and the realization that survival required both humor and adaptation.

**The Cultural Heartbeat:** "Movie Masala" captures the magic of watching ghostly black-and-white films in the Open Air Theatre, where nature seemed to mirror the on-screen drama. We made nightly pilgrimages to Natraj theatre in Mangalore to catch Amitabh Bachchan films—these weren't just entertainment, they were communal rituals.

**Food and Fellowship:** "Beats, Cheats, Eats, Feats, and Treats" revisits the legendary treats of Sadanand, the beauty of Samudra Darshan café, and the famous Gadbadi ice-cream. Food memories are among the strongest—they connect us to place, time, and the people we shared them with.

**Sports and Strategy:** Before IPL, we ran our own cricket league. Complete with team names, betting pools, and commentary that rivaled anything on radio. The ingenuity of bored engineering students should never be underestimated.

**Cultural Legacy:** "Incidentally Speaking" documents the birth of Incident-80, our inter-collegiate cultural festival. Four decades later, it still runs—proof that student-led initiatives can outlast the students who created them.

**The Quirks:** "KREC-licks and Perverse Prose," "Beja Fry," and "Short Takes" capture the verbal tics, inside jokes, and absurd moments that made KREC distinct. Every institution develops its own language; ours was particularly colorful.

**Beyond Campus:** "Onward Journeys" follows batchmates into their professional lives—some predictable, others surprising, all shaped by those four years together.

## Why Humor Matters

The book is deliberately humorous. Not because college life was a comedy, but because humor was how we processed difficulty. The food was bad, the facilities were basic, the academic pressure was real. Laughter was survival.

But humor also reveals truth. When you can laugh at yourself years later, it means you've integrated the experience. You're no longer defensive about the awkwardness of youth—you recognize it as part of the journey.

## What the Book Is Not

This is not a comprehensive history of KREC or NITK. It is not an institutional record. It is not even representative of all 250 students in our batch—everyone's experience was different.

It is one person's attempt to capture the texture of a time and place, knowing that memory is selective, subjective, and shaped by decades of distance.

## The Reunion and the Release

The book was officially released at our batch reunion on July 27, 2024, by Prof. B. Ravi, Director of NITK Surathkal. Returning to campus after 43 years was profound—not because of nostalgia, but because it revealed how much had changed and how much had not.

The physical campus had transformed. The students were different. The curriculum had evolved. But the spirit—the combination of rigor, community, and resilience—felt familiar.

Our batch has stayed connected to NITK through institutional support, sustainability projects, and ongoing engagement. Writing this book was part of that connection—a way to document not just what we learned, but how we learned to be human together.

## A Note on Memory

Memory is not history. It is interpretation shaped by time, experience, and what we choose to remember. Different people will recall the same events differently. Some will remember things I've forgotten. Others will wonder why certain stories made it into the book.

That's as it should be. This book is my version—one perspective among 250. If it prompts others to share their stories, it will have served its purpose.

## Where to Find It

*Once Upon a Time in KREC: Mirthful Musings of '81* is available in both Kindle and print editions on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Once-Upon-Time-KREC-Mirthful-ebook/dp/B0CSDP1RVQ).

If you attended a regional engineering college in India during the 1970s or 1980s, you will recognize these stories. If you're curious about what engineering education looked like before it became a globalized industry, this offers one window.

And if you simply want to read about friendship, food, films, and the chaos of learning to be an adult away from home—this book is for you.
