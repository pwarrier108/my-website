AI has made execution fast, cheap, and abundant. What it hasn't made easier is knowing what's worth doing.

Two articles crossed my mind recently that, read together, reveal something essential about our technological moment.

A few weeks ago, I wrote about a growing concern: "If Everyone Is Doing AI, Who's Doing the Plumbing?" The question wasn't rhetorical. It pointed to the hollowing out of foundational expertise—the people who understand fluid dynamics, distributed systems, thermodynamics, ACID guarantees. The invisible infrastructure that keeps civilization running when abstractions fail.

More recently, my former Microsoft colleague Samir Kumar published an article in The Economic Times "The quiet revolution rewriting the global services economy", describing a quiet but profound shift in the global services economy. His insight was crisp: AI-native companies are decoupling revenue from headcount, moving from labor arbitrage to intelligence arbitrage—measuring success by outcomes per unit of intelligence rather than human effort.

Both articles describe real, accelerating transformations. But read together, they reveal a third and deeper crisis—one that won't show up in GDP statistics, infrastructure metrics, or quarterly earnings calls, yet will determine whether we build a resilient future or a fragile house of cards.

It is a crisis of EQ.

Not emotional intelligence as empathy workshops or soft skills—but something deeper and older. What Indian philosophy calls Viveka: the cultivated capacity to discern what matters before deciding what to build.

## Three Changes, One Risk

We are living through three converging shifts: (a) Economic: AI lets small teams scale output dramatically (b) Infrastructure: Foundational expertise is being hollowed out and (c) Intellectual: Execution is abundant; discernment is becoming scarce.

AI removes friction from building. It does not remove responsibility for deciding what's worth building.

## The EQ Gap

Consider how many AI startups exist to take meeting notes—despite the fact that Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet are already doing this natively. When execution becomes cheap and fast, it becomes easy to mistake "can build" for "should exist." It is important to take a pause.

That pause—the ability to step back and ask whether something matters at all—is EQ in the age of AI.

As I once heard in a tense Microsoft debate: "Thinking is permitted." AI doesn't replace thinking. It amplifies whether we're thinking at all.

## When Abstractions Fail

In my plumbing article, I used an old metaphor: a scholar who knew scriptures but couldn't swim when the storm came.

We're now building an economy optimized for intelligence arbitrage on top of infrastructure that still requires embodied expertise—while systematically eliminating the people who understand it.

Your AI model won't help much when:

Databases corrupt. Power grids destabilize. Water systems fail. Networks hit edge cases no model was trained on.

In those moments, you don't need more IQ. You need people who can swim.

## Cultivating EQ (Viveka)

Viveka isn't abstract philosophy. It shows up as questions:

Is this solving a real problem or just deploying technology because we can? Do we understand the physical and system-level constraints underneath? What breaks at 2 a.m. when the sensors fail? Are we building durable capability—or disposable demos?

The teams that succeed aren't the fastest to deploy models. They're the ones that first understand the systems, the failure modes, and the humans who keep things running.

## What's at Stake

If intelligence arbitrage works—and it will—millions of knowledge workers whose value was execution will be displaced.

The optimistic view is that people move up the value chain. The realistic view is that only those who cultivate EQ—discernment, systems understanding, and judgment under uncertainty—will.

Otherwise, we risk a bifurcated world: a small group fluent in both foundations and AI, and everyone else racing models they can't outrun.

And one question looms largest: Who maintains the foundations when everyone is building in the clouds?

AI has given us extraordinary IQ. Whether we build a resilient future now depends on whether we cultivate the EQ to use it wisely. Because when the storm hits, models won't save you. People who can swim will.
