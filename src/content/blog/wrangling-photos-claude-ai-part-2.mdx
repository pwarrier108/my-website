*Vibe Coding, Token Economics, and Engineering Discipline*

In [Part 1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wrangling-my-10k-photos-agentic-ai-padmanand-warrier-ktcsc/), I described building a 4,000-line Python system to bring order to 10,000+ scattered photographs.

Part 2 is about something more revealing: what happens when Claude Code joins the engineering process — not as a chatbot, but as a coding collaborator.

It turns out that building a search engine was only half the experiment. The other half was understanding how AI changes — and tests — engineering discipline.

## The Good: Acceleration With Structure

Claude Code is remarkable at converting intent into structure. Describe a schema, a module boundary, or a search orchestrator, and it produces a coherent first draft almost instantly. The friction of starting disappears. Iteration becomes easier. Exploration becomes cheaper.

Where it helped the most was not in raw code generation, but in architectural clarification. I would describe the system I envisioned — hybrid search, structured filters, semantic ranking — and Claude would render that into shape. That reflective loop sharpened my own thinking.

Early in the project, I moved everything into a proper Git repository. That decision proved critical. With AI in the loop, version control is not optional; it is survival infrastructure. Commits became deliberate architectural checkpoints. If something drifted, I could recover cleanly.

Used deliberately, Claude Code is an accelerator.

## The Bad: When Abstraction Meets Signal

I invested heavily in designing a natural language search layer — embeddings, query parsing, ranking fusion. On paper, it was elegant.

In practice, something humbling happened.

My existing metadata did most of the work.

Dates from EXIF, GPS-derived locations, folder hierarchy, face tagging, and simple ratings already answered the majority of real-world queries. Structured signals were strong, consistent, and reliable.

The marginal advantage of natural language search — without rich vision-generated tags — was surprisingly small.

To unlock meaningful differentiation, I would have needed automated scene detection, object tagging, activity recognition, and descriptive embeddings generated via a Vision API. Technically feasible. Financially acceptable. But for a personal archive, not cleanly justified.

And that led to a larger realization:

Abstraction without strong signal is decoration. The elegance of semantic search depends on the richness of its inputs. Without signal, embeddings are sophisticated guesswork.

Which brings us to something older than AI:

Fundamentals still win. Dates. Names. Locations. Structure.

They are not glamorous. They are decisive.

## The Ugly: Token Economics and Control

Claude Code has an appetite. Long sessions, multi-module edits, or iterative refactors can burn through tokens faster than expected. In short, Claude Code eats tokens for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And when limits are reached, progress pauses.

Early on, I embraced full "vibe coding" mode. I would describe a feature and let Claude expand it, refine it, and optimize it in increasingly elaborate loops. The velocity felt exhilarating.

It also introduced drift.

Claude is extraordinarily good at generating code. It is less reliable at maintaining architectural intent across long contexts unless you are willing to pay for it. Subtle design decisions can blur. Previously rejected approaches may quietly reappear. The model optimizes locally; architecture is global.

Eventually, I returned to something more classical: plan carefully, implement incrementally, test rigorously, and consult Claude in bounded interactions.

At that point, something shifted. Costs stabilized. Code quality improved. Architecture tightened.

It felt less like improvisation and more like craft.

That led to perhaps the most important lesson:

AI amplifies discipline. It does not replace it. If your architecture is weak, AI accelerates entropy. If your structure is strong, AI accelerates progress.

## A Larger Reflection

This project began as an exercise in organizing photos. It became an exercise in constraint management.

Metadata outperformed abstraction. Structure outperformed novelty. Deliberate design outperformed uncontrolled acceleration.

At the end of it all, I found myself returning to a principle that predates AI:

The tools are extraordinary. The responsibility remains human. The craft still matters.

Claude Code is not yet a "hand it a bunch of requirements and receive a finished system" engine. It is, instead, a force multiplier for engineers who already understand systems, trade-offs, and discipline.

Version 1 wrangled chaos. Version 2 explored intelligence — mine, and the machine's.

Who knows? Perhaps the next journey is about something deeper: what mature engineering looks like in the age of AI collaborators.

And that, I suspect, is a story far bigger than photo search.
