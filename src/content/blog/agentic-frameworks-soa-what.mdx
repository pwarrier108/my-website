summary: "Agentic frameworks are touted as revolutionary, but a veteran's tour through distributed computing—from RPC to CORBA to SOA to microservices—reveals familiar patterns. The labels change, but the wine often tastes the same. What's genuinely different this time is adaptive intelligence over static recipes."

**A Tech Veteran's musings over a sip of SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)**

I recently got into an online discussion about agentic frameworks being the "next big thing." A younger exec enthusiastically explained these "revolutionary" concepts, and I had to smile. After several years of witnessing vendor pitches for projects at Microsoft, Schwab, Walmart, and others, I've seen this vintage before—the labels change, but the wine often tastes the same.

Let me take you through the cellar of distributed computing, vintage by vintage. Pull up a chair, and let's uncork some memories.

## The Early Vintages (1980s)

Remember when RPC (Remote Procedure Call) was the new bottle everyone was raving about? We thought remote procedure calls were magical—until they weren't. Client-server was our first attempt at splitting responsibilities. Simple, direct, but about as flexible as a boxed wine.

## The Boutique Years (1990s)

Then came CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model). Fancy sounding labels, promising cross-platform communication. Like overpriced wines claiming to pair with everything—they didn't. But message-oriented middleware? Now, that started to ferment something new and interesting. We realized not everything needed an immediate response.

## The Mass Market Era (2000s)

SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) was our attempt to standardize and mass-produce services. Web services, XML, SOAP—everything came with an instruction manual. Unfortunately, we ended up with the enterprise equivalent of bulk wine: functional but uninspired. And those ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) bottlenecks? Like a bad cork—frustrating and hard to remove.

## The Craft Movement (2010s)

Microservices entered like the boutique wine revolution. Small-batch, artisanal, independently deployable. Docker and Kubernetes made managing the explosion of services possible. Sure, the operational complexity and DevOps budgets skyrocketed, but the flexibility was intoxicating.

## Today's Blend: Agentic Frameworks

In 2025, Agentic Frameworks are the rage. At first glance, Agentic Frameworks might feel like a natural evolution of SOA. Both emphasize reusable components and distributed systems, and both promise flexibility and scalability. So, is it a case of old wine in new bottles?

Let's look at what's different.

For decades, we've been stuck in the tyranny of if-then-else, or if-this-then-that. First-generation systems require you to imagine every possible sequence in advance. Think of those early marketing automation systems: scripting complex workflows just to send a basic email campaign. You had to be perfect from the start, predicting every potential scenario to avoid chaos.

Agentic frameworks—done right—might change all that.

Ostensibly, these systems no longer make you follow static recipes; they adapt like a master vintner responding to the subtleties of each harvest. With contextual programming, fuzzy logic, and agents that cooperate, you can capture the moment for maximum impact. Instead of rigidly planning for every possibility, you're building systems that are "good enough" to adapt on the fly—like humans do.

Imagine an AI agent tasked with running a marketing campaign. It doesn't need a pre-programmed roadmap to navigate every possible outcome. Instead, it adjusts in real-time based on context (e.g. weather patterns, traffic, inventory), learning from results, and improving over time. That's the power of agentic frameworks—they're less about precision and more about adaptation.

## Addressing Potential Drawbacks

While the flexibility and intelligence of agentic frameworks are exciting, they come with challenges. Increased complexity in system design and maintenance is a real concern. Security risks also rise as distributed intelligence expands the attack surface. Additionally, implementing these systems demands specialized skills that might not be readily available in all organizations. And are we adding to the mountain of tech debt, yet again?

## Exploring Ethical Considerations

Agentic frameworks also raise ethical questions. With AI-driven decision-making, issues like bias, accountability, and unintended consequences can arise. Who is responsible when an autonomous agent makes a mistake? How do we ensure these systems are fair and transparent? What happens when agents go "rouge" with automation? These are critical conversations we must have alongside technical innovation.

## Buyer Beware

Over the years, I've seen enough six-figure proposals from vendors to fund a small vineyard. Here's some seasoned advice:

- Vendor demos are like wine tastings: everything seems amazing after a few sips, but wait until you've lived with it for a month.
- The "revolutionary breakthrough" is often just an evolutionary improvement.
- Your organization needs to be ready to digest what you're buying.
- The fanciest technology won't fix broken business processes.
- ROI projections should be taken with a grain of salt (or maybe a whole shaker with accompanying crackers and cheese).

The real test? Start small. Run a pilot. See how it performs in your environment. The best systems aren't the ones with the flashiest labels—they're the ones that quietly solve real problems while letting your team sleep at night.

As always, read the fine print before signing that purchase order. Then you can feel good about uncorking that label.
