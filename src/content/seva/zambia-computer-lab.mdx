## Background

This whole trip was truly a wonderful dream. It is really a miracle of Swami the way events unfolded. In early 1997, Mr. Victor Kanu came to the Region X retreat in Houston and spoke to the Sai devotees assembled there.

Mr. Kanu’s talk was impressive in many ways. It flowed from the heart and demonstrated implicit obedience to Swami’s will. The Kanus were a couple enjoying the “good life” in London. At Swami’s bidding they sold their belongings and packed up to move literally overnight to a country they had never been before! On reaching Zambia, they started a school from scratch in a poor township on the outskirts of a city called Ndola, which is not even the capital city of Zambia. What was even more remarkable was the kind of students they took in—literally, the dregs of society. These kids were dropouts; those who had failed to make the selection in the exams to enter government schools. They were children without any future, and so were engaged in typical bullying and drinking activities. The miracle of the school is how these kids got transformed—not just academically, but also spiritually. These same underserved students are now impeccable gentlemen who turn in 100% distinction year after year, for the past several years in a row.

Some devotees were inspired enough to make inquires of how they could help the school. An idea that took shape was to setup a computer lab in Zambia. Sai devotees came forward to silently contribute amounts that would fund the project. A devotee offered to build the computers at cost to keep the costs down. Others helped by donating software, and many offered their skills and time. In Swami’s unique way, the silent contributions began to grow until the amount of available funds for the project grew to be sufficient to cover about 15 computers. However, while all of this was happening in the background, the project was dormant until about the middle of Nov 1998. Then things began to move forward rapidly. It suddenly became possible for a team of four devotees to take the trip to go to Zambia to setup the lab over the Christmas holidays. But, the questions still remained. How to build the computers in time? And how to ship them? Then Swami stepped in.

## Examples of Swami’s Guidance

The first question was how to build the computers in time in order to ship them so that they would arrive in Zambia by early December in preparation for the team to do the setup over Christmas. A devotee browsing around the Web was able to locate Compaq Presario computers at Compaq’s outlet store in Houston. The price of the computers for the configuration (Intel 266 Mhz Celeron processor, 32M of RAM, 6G hard drive, 56K modem, plus loads of software including Windows 98, Microsoft Works, and Encarta) was incredible. Even more amazing, there was a special holiday promotion that included a monitor. On the day that a group went to purchase the computers, they found that the promotion price had dropped by another $50, thus enabling the purchase of one more computer than originally anticipated. In short, it was possible to purchase 16 computers, including a server. Thus, Swami made it possible to obtain high quality computers that did not have to be built from scratch, enabling them to be shipped right away.

The next question was how to ship them to Zambia? Several airline companies were contacted. Most came in with quotes of approximately $10/kilo. This would have contributed several thousand dollars in shipping costs. Then one of the devotees mentioned to British Airways that the shipment was to a non-profit school. Immediately, the airline reduced the cost to $4/kilo! Even more interesting, they offered in writing (by way of fax) to insure the shipment at 25 cents for every $100 of value. To the surprise of the devotees who went to ship the computers, the manager at British Airways cargo said that even the discounted insurance was $1.00 per $100 of value, however, since a “mistake” had been made in the quote, they would honor the 25 cents per $100. Only Swami could have caused this mistake!

Another issue concerned training materials. There was a gnawing question in one of the devotee’s minds—the best computer lab would be of no use without any training for the people who would use them. It was recognized that the team going over to Zambia for a couple of weeks would only have sufficient time to setup the lab and give the trainees just enough guidance to “get them over the hump.” So the question remained—what would happen when the team from the US returned after two weeks? Swami, of course, answered in His unique way, as the following account shows:

The computers had been purchased and shipped to Zambia. The team is getting ready to fly over in two days. But during this past week we realized that a big stumbling block would be instructor learning. The instructors in Zambia would have to first learn the computers and software before they could teach it to the students. Self learning with only a book is difficult for teachers and students alike, especially with no computer experience at all.

On Monday I was looking for books in the college book store and saw a CD ROM tutorial for learning software. A student could play it in their multimedia computer and the teacher would be in the video clips on the CD. But the question was, which CDs, how much would they cost, and could we get them in two days?

On Tuesday, I went searching for books and CDs in a college book store. There I saw a display of interactive videos and CD tutorials for computer software. After talking with the manager, he offered to give me the name and phone number of the company representative so that I could deal with him directly for a better price. I then called the representative who agreed to come by my office and give me a demonstration of the software the next day (Wednesday).

In the meantime, I went out on the Internet and searched for other CD Tutorials for software learning. I found another company. After surfing to their site, I downloaded a demo from them and noticed that it looked very much like the first company’s software.

The next day (Wednesday) the representative from the first company shows up at 2:00 pm to do a demo. We were looking at the learning software for a while and during this time the representative began asking about the project. I told him about Zambia and he was interested. Later when we talked about the price, he offered to give a 25% discount on any purchase for an educational institution.

During this conversation, the phone rang and a representative from the second company. While I had never talked to them, he had gotten my phone number and the fact that I worked for Compaq from the information that I had entered before downloading their software the day before. It was a little awkward at first but I decided to go ahead and put both company representatives on the speakerphone.

After a 10 minute conversation, the representative from the second company left to check on a few things for me. Sometime later, I called the second company back. I asked about the sets of CDs they had available for sale and finally asked about the cost. (I knew that the first company would sell them to us at a 25% discount.)

The person put me on hold and after a couple of minutes picked up the phone and said that they would like to donate a complete set of CDs with network licenses which normally sells for several thousand dollars! After I caught my breath, I made sure that I had understood him correctly. I then explained that we were unsure about whether the network would support learning from all of the computers at the same time and asked if it would be possible to do only beginning CDs for each machine in the lab. A little later the same representative (from the second company) called back and said that they would be able to send two complete sets of every CD and some additional beginning and advanced Win 98 CDs. In addition, they agreed to overnight the entire set that same day—just in time for everyone leaving for Zambia (Thursday at 2:00). Wow!

So, to finish things up, I called the first company representative and told him about the donation from his competitor. Not only was he not upset, he said he really liked the idea of improving CD learning with computers and said that he hoped that he and I might be able to work together some day. He also really liked the Zambian project. I took his name and told him thanks and that hopefully, we might be able to work on something together.

To finish up the CD story, it was interesting to note that the cost of goods plus shipment added up (including to the last penny) EXACTLY to the number 9, an auspicious number. Furthermore, it was also interesting that on the flight from London to Lusaka (capital of Zambia), the seats got reassigned to row number 36, and the flight took off from gate 54. And all the flight numbers (both going and coming) added up to number 9! The team left the U.S. “Sai incidentally” on a Thursday.

While all this was happening, half way across the world, Victor Kanu was talking to Swami about the computers on the occasion of His birthday. Swami just smiled and said “Very Happy.” Of course, He was! He was orchestrating the whole thing! When Mr. Kanu returned to Ndola in early December he had to gear up to prepare a room that would hold 36 boxes (the number 9 again) of the shipment from the U.S. There were less than 2 weeks left to prepare before the team from the U.S. arrived. Once again, with Swami’s guidance a room of sufficient size was found. It was cleaned up and painted in preparation. A local devotee came forward to donate floor tiles to keep the room clean. Custom tables were ordered and delivered. Conduits were purchased to run the power and network cables to each table.

## Initial Impressions on Arrival

The team from the U.S. arrived in Lusaka on Dec 19th where they were met by a local devotee at the airport. There were the little “Swami” tests—the customs wanted to inspect “everything,” while the connecting flight to Ndola was supposed to leave in 45 minutes. Needless to say, there were no customs problems, and the flight to Ndola waited till everyone got on board. The Lusaka to Ndola flight was on a propeller plane that reminded people of getting on a bus in India. After a brief stop at a town called Kitwe, on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon, the team arrived in Ndola where they were met by Mr. Kanu and others.

From the airport, the team was taken to school compound, where accommodations had been arranged in a guest house, adjacent to the teachers quarters. A sumptuous lunch had been prepared which was a precursor of many such lunches and dinners to come. After lunch, the team visited the computer lab and saw for the first time, the tremendous preparations that had been on-going in the last few days. A pleasant surprise was the discovery of the conduits to route the power and network cables. Not knowing what to expect, the team had brought “duck tape” in the expectation of taping things down if need be. Instead, the conduits really helped to give the lab a professional look.

## Setting Up the Lab

Although the basic infrastructure was there, a lot of work still remained. Everything had to be done from scratch. The students, teachers, workers, school staff and the U.S. team all got to work right away. The computers were first stored in a staging area in the secondary school library while the lab was being prepared. After the lab was cleaned and whitewashed, movable bamboo scaffolding was constructed to enable workers to reach the ceiling to mount the conducts to hold the heavy power cables. This was followed by mounting conduits for the network cables. Tables were bolted down on the floor and aligned to match the conduits for power and network cables dropping down.

While the lab was being constructed, the secondary school library was used not only as a staging area but also a place to conduct a hardware maintenance lab. A couple of old Compaq Deskpro DOS based computers provided the perfect basis to instruct a couple of teachers on the basics of computer components, taking them apart and putting them back together. Of course, both units booted up successfully after the training was over! Another activity that occurred in parallel was setting up an administrative PC for use by the school secretary. The administrative PC was an existing clone PC—this had to be setup with the proper software, and printer connections to make it useful.

Things could not have gone smoothly for ever. Swami started His “tests.” The first problem occurred on the first day itself. Despite numerous checks, and rechecks, the power supply of one of the computers blew when it was connected to the 220V mains with a 110V setting. Another computer would not come up at all. This turned out to be an opportunity to practically implement the hardware maintenance training. By combining the working parts of both the units, it was possible to salvage one functional computer between the two. The other became useful for spare parts. Other problems surfaced on the administrative clone PC. Its primary drive controller had been incorrectly installed, causing read errors on the hard drive. A lot of effort went into swapping out drives and controllers and reinstalling the software and the printer to get things just right.

One interesting “test” occurred with the problem of trying to create an image of all the software on a lab computer that could be stored on the server. The idea was that this stored image on the server could be then downloaded across the network to restore the image in case of a problem with a computer. The problem was the necessary driver software for the network card was not available. In other words, the issue was how to create the image and download the software without the network connectivity that the network driver would provide? Several days were spent trying to contact various places in Ndola to try and track down the driver, calling friends in the US to send the driver by email, and even connecting to the Internet in an attempt to download the driver. None of these efforts were fruitful. Then, at the 11th hour, Swami showed the way. It turned out that the necessary driver was there, all along in the Windows directory of each computer! People had been searching all over when it was right under their noses!

## Impressions

The place reminded me a lot like India. The climate was generally mild. It was the rainy season, but the rains didn’t affect us too much. When it did rain, however, it was really a downpour with lots of thunder and lightning. Good news is that it would all be over in an hour.

The food was excellent. We had full-course meals for both lunch and dinner. The Kanus have a chef who used to be with a South Indian couple, so in addition to all kinds of delicious soups, breads, and desserts, we even had authentic Indian food cooked by this African chef (Naan, Puris, Saag Paneer, Kurma, Beans Poriyal and Kootu Curry)!

We didn’t have time to go sight-seeing or do a lot of shopping, but did manage to get a little bit of curios to bring back. Mostly copper stuff, since copper mining is big. In fact, the region we were in is called the “Copper Belt.”

All in all, a beautiful trip and one that I will cherish forever.
