The AI gold rush is here. Everywhere I turn—conferences, LinkedIn feeds, customer meetings—the conversation loops back to the same glittering promise: AI will do everything. Students are pivoting to prompt engineering. Bootcamps promise instant transformation. Companies are slapping LLMs on products that barely needed a search bar.

In all this excitement, one question keeps bothering me: **If everyone is doing AI, who's doing the plumbing?**

And I mean both kinds of plumbing—the literal kind under your kitchen sink, and the invisible digital kind holding our entire world together.

## The Abstraction Problem (and a Microsoft Memory)

Abstraction is a gift. It lets more people build more things, faster. But abstraction has a dangerous side effect—it encourages tool worship without theory, convenience without comprehension.

Years ago at Microsoft, we were stuck in a debate about a product issue. Everyone had an opinion; no one had clarity. After listening patiently, our Group Program Manager finally cut in with one line:

**"Thinking is permitted."**

It landed like a Zen koan in a room full of smart technologists. A reminder that tools—even powerful ones—don't replace thinking. They merely amplify whether we're using our brains at all.

And this pattern hasn't changed. Recently I stumbled on an article celebrating someone who wrote an "algorithm" to list celebrities whose names start with A and end with I. Clever? Maybe. Necessary? Hardly. A perfect example of deploying extraordinary capability for extraordinarily trivial outcomes—compute without contemplation.

Today, AI is amplifying the same temptation: let the tool think for us. But someone still has to understand what the tool is doing—and what sits beneath it.

## "Robots Will Do the Plumbing"—Will They?

Some will counter my argument by saying, "Don't worry, robots will handle the plumbing."

Sure. But let's be honest:

- Robots don't crawl under sinks.
- They don't contort themselves into crawl spaces.
- They don't diagnose unpredictable physical failures in real time.
- And if they tried, you'd be staring at a seven-figure prototype, not a service call.

We haven't remotely cracked the price–performance curve for robots that handle messy, irregular, physical work in tight environments. Yes, in industrial automation, but not for consumer scale. We can make a humanoid robot dance but ask it to replace a leaking P-trap and the economics fall apart.

Automation loves repeatable tasks in predictable spaces. Plumbing—literal or digital—is neither.

And even if someone believes AI will magically solve everything, there's another question we conveniently skip: **who is paying for the massive data centers needed to train and run these models?** These aren't clouds floating in the sky; they're giant physical fortresses consuming land, water, power, rare minerals, and billions in capital. We speak about AI as if it's frictionless, but its footprint is enormous—and growing faster than our ability to fund, cool, or power it. If everyone insists on building AI skyscrapers, someone still has to pour the concrete underneath.

## Where the Foundations Are Fraying

The deeper concern isn't plumbing itself; it's the hollowing out of foundational expertise—the gritty ground truth underneath our glossy generative tools.

**Physical infrastructure demands:**
- Fluid dynamics, chemistry, microbiology
- Thermodynamics, structural engineering
- Physics, materials science, safety engineering

**Digital infrastructure demands:**
- Algorithms, data structures, ACID guarantees
- Networking fundamentals, distributed systems theory
- OS internals, storage design, security architecture

These subjects don't trend on LinkedIn. They don't fit into weekend workshops. But they're the load-bearing pillars of civilization.

Ignore them, and we're building the AI future on quicksand.

## A Boatman, a Scholar, and a Storm

There's an old story I love.

A scholar was crossing a river in a small boat. He asked the boatman, "Do you know the scriptures?" The boatman said no. The scholar sniffed, "Then half your life is wasted."

Midway across, a storm hit. The boat began to rock violently.

The boatman calmly asked, "Sir, do you know how to swim?" "Of course not!" the scholar cried. The boatman smiled. "In that case, all your life is about to be wasted."

**The moral isn't anti-intellectual. It's simple: Foundations save you when abstractions fail.**

And right now, we're raising a generation of scholars who know the scriptures of AI, but not the swimming of systems.

## The Expertise Gap Is Widening

At the top of the stack, we have people who can use AI tools. At the bottom, we need people who understand fundamental systems.

But the middle—the bridge between the two—is thinning.

Systems sag when specialists disappear. Infrastructure becomes invisible until it fails. And when it fails, we'll discover we've optimized ourselves out of resilience.

## So, What Do We Do?

Ignoring AI is impossible. But ignoring foundational work is irresponsible.

**1. Recognize the full stack of expertise.**  
Celebrate systems thinkers, not just prompt whisperers.

**2. Transfer knowledge before it retires.**  
Senior engineers and skilled tradespeople carry tacit wisdom we cannot afford to lose.

**3. Build hybrid professionals.**  
AI engineers who understand databases. IoT designers who understand thermodynamics. Water specialists who understand fluid dynamics and ML. We have to embrace and extend AI.

**4. Reinforce fundamentals.**  
Math. Physics. Chemistry. Algorithms. Systems. The boring, beautiful bedrock.

**5. Respect essential work.**  
The person who can fix the grid, restore the database, or stop the leak is not old-school. They are essential.

## Smart Meets H.E.A.R.T.—Again

This is where my H.E.A.R.T. idea returns—**Human-centric, Entrepreneurial, Asset-driven, Regenerative, and Technology-enabled.** Because the future won't be built by specialists in silos, but by people who appreciate the whole ecosystem—from sensors to sewage lines, from models to material science.

AI is powerful. But your model won't help much when:

- the database corrupts itself,
- the cooling system fails,
- the grid goes down, or
- the plumbing backs up.

For that, you need the thinking humans, not sinking robots. Let's make sure we still have them.
