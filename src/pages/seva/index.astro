        <p>
            Service (seva) is both a spiritual practice and practical commitment. This section documents 
            efforts to give back: community service inspired by spiritual teachings, frameworks for 
            sustainable innovation, and mentorship to help others build their own capabilities.

                    Seva—service as spiritual practice—begins with Sri Sathya Sai Baba's teaching that  
                    "Service to Man is Service to God." From nursing homes in Houston to computer labs in  
                    Zambia, from feeding the homeless in Seattle to organizing dental camps, these initiatives  
                    reflect collective service to the community that I have been privileged to participate in and 
                    learn from. They are not acts of charity, but formative experiences that continue to  
                    inform how I serve—grounded in the belief that in serving others, we serve the Divine.

                    From guiding young adults in spiritual communities to mentoring startups in 
                    entrepreneurial ecosystems to building alumni networks and student mentorship 
                    programs at NITK. The focus is on helping people ask better questions, build 
                    judgment and capability, and serve with integrity—so that mentorship scales 
                    beyond individuals to create lasting institutional capacity.
