## Core Concept

If we plan exit strategies for businesses, why not for life?

This framework, originally presented as closing remarks to young adults in the Sri Sathya Sai Organization before my move to Texas, applies systems thinking to intentional living. Drawing on Steve Jobs’ Stanford commencement speech about mortality as clarity, it asks: what would change if we regularly remembered that our time is finite?

## The Framework

*[Full framework details to be added]*
