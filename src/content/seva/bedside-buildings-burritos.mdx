## The Foundation

Across three decades and three cities—Connecticut in the 1980s, Houston in the 1990s, the Pacific Northwest in the 2000s—the work looked different but the lessons accumulated. Each phase built on what came before.

These were my introduction to the service aspect of the Sathya Sai organization. The idea of serving—putting spiritual principles into practice through direct action—was what drew me in. These weren't large-scale projects that garnered attention. But they were where I learned the fundamentals.

## Connecticut 1980s: Starting Out

The soup kitchen was the first step beyond writing checks. Some of the people we served hadn't showered in days. Some were hostile at first. Learning to look past appearance and initial attitude took practice. Over time, many became friendly. Consistency mattered more than enthusiasm.

That same year, we joined Christmas in April, rehabilitating homes for low-income elderly and disabled homeowners. The constraint was built into the name: all repairs had to be completed in one day. The planning took weeks—assessing homes, procuring materials, coordinating volunteers—but the execution happened in a single concentrated effort.

Someone had to match volunteers to tasks—skilled tradespeople on plumbing, willing hands on painting. Everything had to finish on schedule because there was no day two.

Two lessons from that first exposure: get past your own discomfort to see the person, and logistics matter as much as goodwill.

## Houston 1990s: Making It Work

The nursing home visits extended what Connecticut taught. We committed to serving about fifty residents monthly—not a single event, but sustained practice. And we brought our families along.

The "Seva Mobile"—an old beat-up van—held two families: two couples and four kids, packed together for drives across Houston. We'd bring sugar-free ice cream and soft peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Sugar-free because many had diabetes. Soft because many had no teeth.

We'd serve the food, play bingo, sit with them. One resident, asked about our group's name, said: "Don't know the name, but they're a good group."

The earlier lesson about looking past surface discomfort now applied with family present. The kids learned by watching. The coordination was straightforward—prepare food, transport it, serve with dignity—but now it had to work month after month, not just once.

## Pacific Northwest 2000s: Building Systems

By the time we reached Washington, the earlier lessons had compounded. Rebuilding Together in Thurston County operated like Christmas in April had two decades earlier—wheelchair ramps, plumbing fixes, safety modifications. Annual "Rebuilding Day" followed the same model: weeks of planning, one day of execution.

But now the coordination challenge was familiar. Break complex work into manageable tasks. Match people to appropriate roles. Plan logistics carefully. Execute methodically. The pattern had been practiced in Connecticut, refined in Houston, and now applied at larger scale.

<img src={burritoCart.src} alt="Cart loaded with fresh ingredients outside New Horizons Ministries" style="float: right; max-width: 300px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />

The monthly burrito service added another dimension—sustained operations at scale. New Horizons Ministries served street youth in downtown Seattle, many dealing with homelessness, addiction, or family trauma. We provided hundreds of burritos every month, for years.

The logistics were more complex than anything we'd done before. Fresh ingredients needed to arrive on schedule—rice, beans, cheese, tortillas, all in quantities that would feed a hundred or more people. Storage had to be managed. Equipment had to be ready. Volunteers had to be coordinated to procure and bring ingredients on time, and be available for the assembly line.

<img src={burritoAssembly.src} alt="Volunteers in hairnets assembling burritos in commercial kitchen" style="float: right; max-width: 300px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />

The operation ran in their commercial kitchen. Spanish rice and beans kept warm in large steam trays. Tortillas heated continuously on griddles. The assembly line was choreographed: warm tortillas passed down the line, filled with rice, beans, and cheese, wrapped individually in foil, then stacked for delivery.

Each volunteer had a role. One kept tortillas flowing. Another managed the rice. Someone else handled the wrapping. The coordinator monitored the count, adjusted the pace, ensured quality stayed consistent even as speed increased.

<img src={burritoStack.src} alt="Massive stack of wrapped burritos ready for distribution" style="float: right; max-width: 300px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />

Hundreds of burritos. Every month. Same process. The stack would grow until it filled large warming containers, ready for the street outreach teams to distribute.

I wasn't coordinating this operation, just volunteering as part of the assembly line. But watching it function month after month taught what the earlier projects had hinted at: sustainable service requires systems, not extraordinary effort. You need supply chain management—ingredients ordered in bulk, delivered on schedule. You need process design—the assembly line optimized for speed without sacrificing quality. You need consistent execution—the same reliable output, month after month, regardless of which volunteers showed up.

This was what the soup kitchen and Christmas in April had started twenty years earlier, now evolved into repeatable operations. The difference was scale and sophistication. We weren't just serving meals anymore. We were running a production operation.

## What Accumulated

Each phase built on the previous one.

Connecticut taught the basics: look past discomfort, coordinate volunteers, finish what you start. The one-day constraint of Christmas in April made planning essential—there was no buffer for mistakes.

Houston added repeatability make it work month after month, involve family, maintain humility and respect.

The Pacific Northwest applied those lessons at larger scale and higher complexity: sophisticated volunteer coordination, supply chain thinking, process design that sustains.

By the end, the skills were transferable. Volunteer coordination became managing cross-functional teams. Supply chain thinking applied to platform engineering. Process design scaled to organizational transformation.

The foundation for later work in digital transformation at Microsoft and beyond was laid here. Not through abstraction, but through repeated practice under real constraints, with each decade building on what came before.
