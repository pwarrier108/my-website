Vegetable washing machines.

Service technicians from Haier, a well-known manufacturer of white goods in China, noticed an inordinate number of washing machine failures in rural areas. Motors were burning out at an alarming rate. When engineers investigated further, they discovered that local farmers were using the washing machines to clean vegetables. The drains clogged, the motors overheated, and the machines failed.

Instead of trying to “educate the consumer on proper use,” Haier recognized an opportunity. The development team created a washing machine and a wash cycle specifically designed for cleaning vegetables. This example is often cited as a breakthrough driven by uncovering hidden needs, including in Paul Sloan’s *Destination Innovation*.

Similarly, Rubbermaid developed heat-resistant plastic spatulas after researchers observed cooks in China stirring food at temperatures as high as 500 degrees.

Other examples abound: sticky notes, coffee mug holders in cars, and scroll wheels for browsing.

## When Empathy Fails

Now consider the other side of the coin. What happens when companies fail to understand hidden emotions, misgivings, and cultural biases?

Perhaps the most famous example is New Coke. Despite outperforming the original formula in blind taste tests—and even beating Pepsi—the research failed to surface the deep emotional attachment customers felt toward the original. The backlash was swift. Fans boycotted New Coke, forcing the company to reintroduce Coca-Cola Classic.

Other missteps include Colgate Kitchen Entrees, Clairol’s Touch of Yogurt Shampoo, and Harley-Davidson perfume—cases where brand familiarity did not translate into customer acceptance.

## Culture and Language Traps

Culture and language introduce additional pitfalls.

Gerber struggled to sell baby food in parts of Africa until realizing that consumers interpreted the picture on the label literally. In many African markets, packaging imagery reflects the contents, not branding.

Clairol’s “Mist Stick” curling iron performed poorly in Germany because *mist* is slang for manure. KFC’s slogan “Finger Licking Good” was translated in Hong Kong as “Eat Your Fingers Off.”

## Taking Off Our Own Shoes

As product managers, we often talk about representing the “voice of the customer.” Doing so requires remembering that there are both hidden opportunities and hidden risks beneath the surface.

“Walk in the shoes of the customer” is an oft-used—and sometimes abused—phrase. A wiser version is this:

> “Before you can walk in your customers’ shoes, you need to take off your own.”

That idea has a Zen-like quality. Much like emptying one’s cup before a Zen master can fill it, it requires setting aside preconceptions and assumptions.

For me, this means being genuinely curious and open to new ideas. It means recognizing that what appears irrational to me may be entirely rational to the customer—because in their context, it is.

## What I Now Focus On

When I meet customers, I concentrate on a few key questions and take extensive notes.

*What is the task at hand?*  
For example, Marcia, a busy mother, wants to email photos from her daughter’s birthday party to her father in another city.

*Why—what is the motivation?*  
Is it functional, emotional, or both? In this case, it is primarily emotional: the joy of sharing.

*What is the ultimate goal?*  
Sharing memories, but also overcoming physical distance.

*What are the pain points and constraints?*  
Upload time. Access to a computer. Technical confidence.

*What are the alternatives?*  
Would email still be the best option if constraints were removed? Would instant messaging work better?

So next time you plan a customer visit, take your notebook—and your shoes.

Just remember to leave your own behind when you walk in.
