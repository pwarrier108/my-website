## Background

This whole trip was truly a wonderful dream. It is really a miracle of Swami the way events unfolded. In early 1997, Mr. Victor Kanu came to the Region 10 retreat in Houston and spoke to the Sai devotees assembled there.

Mr. Kanu's talk was impressive in many ways. It flowed from the heart and demonstrated implicit obedience to Swami's will. The Kanus were a couple enjoying the "good life" in London. At Swami's bidding they sold their belongings and packed up to move literally overnight to a country they had never been before! On reaching Zambia, they started a school from scratch in a poor township on the outskirts of a city called Ndola, which is not even the capital city of Zambia. What was even more remarkable was the kind of students they took in—literally, the dregs of society. These kids were dropouts; those who had failed to make the selection in the exams to enter government schools. They were children without any future, and so were engaged in typical bullying and drinking activities. The miracle of the school is how these kids got transformed—not just academically, but also spiritually. These same underserved students are now impeccable gentlemen who turn in 100% distinction year after year, for the past several years in a row.

Some devotees were inspired enough to make inquires of how they could help the school. An idea that took shape was to setup a computer lab in Zambia. Sai devotees came forward to silently contribute amounts that would fund the project. A devotee offered to build the computers at cost to keep the costs down. Others helped by donating software, and many offered their skills and time. In Swami's unique way, the silent contributions began to grow until the amount of available funds for the project grew to be sufficient to cover about 15 computers. However, while all of this was happening in the background, the project was dormant until about the middle of Nov 1998. Then things began to move forward rapidly. It suddenly became possible for a team of four devotees to take the trip to go to Zambia to setup the lab over the Christmas holidays. But, the questions still remained. How to build the computers in time? And how to ship them? Then Swami stepped in.

## Examples of Swami's Guidance

The first question was how to build the computers in time in order to ship them so that they would arrive in Zambia by early December in preparation for the team to do the setup over Christmas. A devotee browsing around the Web was able to locate Compaq Presario computers at Compaq's outlet store in Houston. The configuration represented leading edge hardware and educational software at that time—multimedia-capable systems with comprehensive educational packages including Microsoft Office, Encarta encyclopedia, and interactive learning programs like Reader Rabbit, Math Blaster, and Carmen Sandiego. Even more amazing, there was a special holiday promotion that included a monitor. On the day that a group went to purchase the computers, they found that the promotion price had dropped by another $50, thus enabling the purchase of one more computer than originally anticipated. In short, it was possible to purchase 16 computers, including a server. Thus, Swami made it possible to obtain high quality computers that did not have to be built from scratch, enabling them to be shipped right away.

The next question was how to ship them to Zambia? Several airline companies were contacted. Most came in with quotes of approximately $10/kilo. This would have contributed several thousand dollars in shipping costs. Then one of the devotees mentioned to British Airways that the shipment was to a non-profit school. Immediately, the airline reduced the cost to $4/kilo! Even more interesting, they offered in writing (by way of fax) to insure the shipment at 25 cents for every $100 of value. To the surprise of the devotees who went to ship the computers, the manager at British Airways cargo said that even the discounted insurance was $1.00 per $100 of value, however, since a "mistake" had been made in the quote, they would honor the 25 cents per $100. Only Swami could have caused this mistake!

Another issue concerned training materials. The best computer lab would be of no use without training for the people who would use them. The team going to Zambia for two weeks would only have time to setup the lab and provide basic guidance. What would happen after they returned? With departure just two days away, the need for self-paced learning materials became urgent. The answer came through an unexpected sequence of events—two competing software companies somehow both contacted the same devotee on the same afternoon. After learning about the Zambia project, one company donated a complete set of interactive CD-ROM tutorials with network licenses, worth several thousand dollars, and arranged overnight delivery. The timing was perfect: the package arrived just as the team was leaving for the airport.

While all this was happening, half way across the world, Victor Kanu was talking to Swami about the computers on the occasion of His birthday. Swami just smiled and said "Very Happy." Of course, He was! He was orchestrating the whole thing! When Mr. Kanu returned to Ndola in early December he had to gear up to prepare a room that would hold 36 boxes of the shipment from the U.S. There were less than 2 weeks left to prepare before the team from the U.S. arrived. Once again, with Swami's guidance a room of sufficient size was found. It was cleaned up and painted in preparation. A local devotee came forward to donate floor tiles to keep the room clean. Custom tables were ordered and delivered. Conduits were purchased to run the power and network cables to each table.

## Initial Impressions on Arrival

The team from the U.S. arrived in Lusaka on Dec 19th where they were met by a local devotee at the airport. There were the little "Swami" tests—the customs wanted to inspect "everything," while the connecting flight to Ndola was supposed to leave in 45 minutes. Needless to say, there were no customs problems, and the flight to Ndola waited till everyone got on board. The Lusaka to Ndola flight was on a propeller plane that reminded people of getting on a bus in India. After a brief stop at a town called Kitwe, on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon, the team arrived in Ndola where they were met by Mr. Kanu and others.

From the airport, the team was taken to school compound, where accommodations had been arranged in a guest house, adjacent to the teachers quarters. A sumptuous lunch had been prepared which was a precursor of many such lunches and dinners to come. After lunch, the team visited the computer lab and saw for the first time, the tremendous preparations that had been on-going in the last few days. A pleasant surprise was the discovery of the conduits to route the power and network cables. Not knowing what to expect, the team had brought "duck tape" in the expectation of taping things down if need be. Instead, the conduits really helped to give the lab a professional look.

## Setting Up the Lab

<img src={crewWorking.src} alt="US crew working along with local team to setup the lab" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
Although the basic infrastructure was there, a lot of work still remained. Everything had to be done from scratch. The students, teachers, workers, school staff and the U.S. team all got to work right away. The computers were first stored in a staging area in the secondary school library while the lab was being prepared. After the lab was cleaned and whitewashed, movable bamboo scaffolding was constructed to enable workers to reach the ceiling to mount the conducts to hold the heavy power cables. This was followed by mounting conduits for the network cables. Tables were bolted down on the floor and aligned to match the conduits for power and network cables dropping down.

<img src={labImage.src} alt="Lab taking shape with computers and infrastructure installed" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
While the lab was being constructed, the secondary school library was used not only as a staging area but also a place to conduct a hardware maintenance lab. A couple of old Compaq Deskpro DOS based computers provided the perfect basis to instruct a couple of teachers on the basics of computer components, taking them apart and putting them back together. Of course, both units booted up successfully after the training was over! Another activity that occurred in parallel was setting up an administrative PC for use by the school secretary. The administrative PC was an existing clone PC—this had to be setup with the proper software, and printer connections to make it useful. Finally, the lab started to take shape.

However, things could not have gone smoothly for ever. Swami started His "tests." The first problem occurred on the first day itself. Despite numerous checks, and rechecks, the power supply of one of the computers blew when it was connected to the 220V mains with a 110V setting. Another computer would not come up at all. This turned out to be an opportunity to practically implement the hardware maintenance training. By combining the working parts of both the units, it was possible to salvage one functional computer between the two. The other became useful for spare parts. Other problems surfaced on the administrative clone PC. Its primary drive controller had been incorrectly installed, causing read errors on the hard drive. A lot of effort went into swapping out drives and controllers and reinstalling the software and the printer to get things just right.

One interesting "test" occurred with the problem of trying to create an image of all the software on a lab computer that could be stored on the server. The idea was that this stored image on the server could be then downloaded across the network to restore the image in case of a problem with a computer. The problem was the necessary driver software for the network card was not available. In other words, the issue was how to create the image and download the software without the network connectivity that the network driver would provide? Several days were spent trying to contact various places in Ndola to try and track down the driver, calling friends in the US to send the driver by email, and even connecting to the Internet in an attempt to download the driver. None of these efforts were fruitful. Then, at the 11th hour, Swami showed the way. It turned out that the necessary driver was there, all along in the Windows directory of each computer! People had been searching all over when it was right under their noses!

## Impressions

The place reminded me a lot like India. The climate was generally mild. It was the rainy season, but the rains didn't affect us too much. When it did rain, however, it was really a downpour with lots of thunder and lightning. Good news is that it would all be over in an hour.

<img src={dinnerService.src} alt="Sumptuous dinner being served" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
The food was excellent. We had full-course meals for both lunch and dinner. The Kanus have a chef who used to be with a South Indian couple, so in addition to all kinds of delicious soups, breads, and desserts, we even had authentic Indian food cooked by this African chef (Naan, Puris, Saag Paneer, Kurma, Beans Poriyal and Kootu Curry)!

It was mango season—summer in the Southern Hemisphere—and the mangos were a revelation. Unlike the tall trees of India, these mango trees stood only four to five feet high, yet yielded fruit the size of small watermelons. We ate them both ripe and raw, seasoned with chilli powder, salt, and a hint of oil. The sweet ones rivaled any I'd tasted in India, while the raw ones had that perfect tartness that made the simple seasoning sing.

We didn't have time to go sight-seeing or do a lot of shopping, but did manage to get a little bit of curios to bring back. Mostly copper stuff, since copper mining is big. In fact, the region we were in is called the "Copper Belt."

The teachers and staff embraced the new technology with enthusiasm and dedication. Their joy was evident not just in how quickly they learned, but in how they celebrated together. One evening, the boys gathered to sing traditional Zambian songs—a moment of cultural sharing that reminded us that technology serves people, not the other way around.

All in all, a beautiful trip and one that I will cherish forever.
