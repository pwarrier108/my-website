## The Persistent Challenge

Every digital transformation is an organizational transformation. The technology part was never the hard part.

Across telecommunications infrastructure, enterprise systems, cloud platforms, and now sustainable AI at NITK, the pattern repeats: you need people who don't report to you to do things they weren't planning to do. "It's not my job" becomes the refrain you learn to *work with*, not *fight against*.

This is matrix leadership—whether you're an individual contributor or running cross-functional initiatives. Authority doesn't solve it. Influence does.

My understanding of why and how to lead came from spiritual practice and service work—lessons I've written about elsewhere. But I still needed tactical frameworks for corporate matrix environments. How do you systematically build credibility across organizational boundaries? How do you mobilize teams when everyone's already fully occupied? How do you maintain momentum when inertia, not resistance, is your real enemy?

Patty Azzarello's two books answered those questions with operational precision.

## RISE: Building Credibility Systematically

Azzarello became the youngest general manager at HP at thirty-three, ran a billion-dollar business at thirty-five, became CEO at thirty-eight. "RISE" distills how she did it into three steps: Do Better, Look Better, Connect Better.

The framework sounds simple. Its power is in the specifics. Do Better means ruthless priorities—focusing on high-impact work and saying no to everything else. Look Better means strategic visibility—making sure the right people know what you've accomplished. Connect Better means building genuine relationships that create mutual value over time.

What made RISE essential for me: it showed how to build influence without formal authority. In matrix organizations, you can't mandate priorities or force collaboration. You build credibility systematically—through strategic work, thoughtful visibility, and genuine connection.

This framework shaped how I approached every transformation. When leading cross-functional initiatives—whether enterprise deployments or building the NITK AI Centre—I couldn't rely on authority. I needed people to choose to prioritize our shared work. RISE showed me how to build that foundation: deliver impact, make it visible to stakeholders who control resources, develop relationships that turn skeptics into allies.

The lesson that stuck: good work doesn't speak for itself. You must be strategic about visibility and connection, not because you're political, but because transformation requires coalition-building across boundaries.

## MOVE: Defeating Organizational Inertia
<img src={picMOVE.src} alt="Book Cover of 'MOVE'" style="float: right; max-width: 250px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
"MOVE" addresses what happens after you announce a strategy. People nod. Then everyone returns to what they were already doing.

Azzarello's insight: organizational inertia isn't resistance—it's physics. People are already fully occupied. Your new strategy competes with a hundred existing priorities. Unless you explicitly create space and make the new thing more compelling, nothing changes.

Her framework—Middle, Organization, Valor, Everyone—breaks this down. Plan for what happens during execution, not just the endpoint. Work with the team you have. Defend the strategy when pressure mounts to revert to familiar patterns. Create genuine engagement, not just compliance.

This reframed every transformation I led. The problem wasn't that people disagreed with the strategy. They just had no bandwidth to execute it. MOVE taught me to explicitly remove work, create space, and build momentum that could sustain itself when my attention moved elsewhere.

The tactical approach that changed everything: treat organizational change like physics. Don't fight inertia—redirect it. Make the new direction easier than staying still. Build systems that maintain momentum without constant intervention.

## How They Worked Together

My deeper understanding of leadership came from service work and spiritual practice. Those experiences taught me to lead through genuine care, through alignment with higher purpose, through serving something larger than organizational success.

But corporate matrix environments demand specific operational approaches. You need systematic methods for building credibility. You need tactical frameworks for mobilizing organizations. You need tested techniques for sustaining momentum across organizational boundaries.

RISE and MOVE provided that operational layer. They didn't teach me why leadership matters—I learned that elsewhere. They showed me how to lead effectively in matrix environments where "It's not my job" is the constant reality.

Across corporate transformations and service initiatives, the challenge remained constant: mobilizing people without authority, building coalitions across boundaries, maintaining momentum when everyone has competing priorities. These books gave me frameworks that worked—not because they're inspiring, but because they're operationally precise.

When building products at Microsoft or establishing the NITK AI Centre, I used the same principles. Build credibility through consistent delivery. Make progress visible to stakeholders. Develop genuine relationships. Plan for the middle, not just the endpoint. Create engagement, not compliance. Sustain momentum.

The books helped me operationalize what I'd learned from service: leadership is influence at scale, whether you're mobilizing corporate teams or institutional partnerships.

## Why They Matter

Matrix leadership is the reality of technology work. You're always working across boundaries, always building without authority, always navigating organizational complexity.

Digital transformation requires organizational transformation. New technology means asking people to change established patterns, learn new systems, shift priorities—all while maintaining current operations. This fails not because people resist change, but because they're already at capacity.

Azzarello's books solve this systematically. RISE builds your influence. MOVE shows you how to deploy it. Together, they provide tactical approaches for the daily work of leading when no one reports to you.

These books belong on your shelf for practical operational guidance. They complement deeper understanding about why leadership matters by providing specific techniques for how to lead effectively in matrix environments.

That's their value: tactical precision about influence without authority, tested by someone who led at scale, applicable whether you're running transformations or building institutions.
