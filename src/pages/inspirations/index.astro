            No life is built alone. The ideas and systems I work on are shaped by the people who raised me, the cultures I have lived within, and the thinkers and creators who continue to challenge and expand my view of what is possible.

            <p>
                My parents led me to spiritual inquiry, including a close association with Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Since early childhood, His teachings continue to shape how I think about purpose, leadership, and the role of technology in serving people with compassion and dignity.

            <p>
                My parents shaped my worldview long before technology did—kindness as strength, discipline without hardness, humor in difficulty, and the belief that learning never ends. Much of what I attempt now is, in some way, homage to them.

            <p>
                From Australia to Zambia, and many places in between, landscapes, food, conversations, and cultural traditions have widened my sense of belonging. I find wisdom in discussions shared over chai as much as in research labs or boardrooms.
