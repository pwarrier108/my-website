        <p>
            No life is built alone. The ideas and systems I work on are shaped by the people who raised me, the cultures I have lived within, and the thinkers and creators who continue to challenge and expand my view of what is possible.

                    My parents led me to spiritual inquiry, including a close association with Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Since early childhood, His teachings continue to shape how I think about purpose, leadership, and the role of technology in serving people with compassion and dignity.

                <p>
                    My parents shaped my worldview long before technology did—kindness as strength, discipline without hardness, humor in difficulty, and the belief that learning never ends. Much of what I attempt now is, in some way, homage to them.

                    World leaders who navigated uncertainty with clarity, technology pioneers who imagined possibilities before the tools existed, and mentors who expanded my understanding of what it means to build systems that serve.

                    From Australia to Zambia, and many places in between, landscapes, food, conversations, and cultural traditions have widened my sense of belonging. I find wisdom in discussions shared over chai as much as in research labs or boardrooms.
