## Background
<img src={picProfile.src} alt="Profile of young U.K. Warrier" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />

My father, Ukkath Krishna Warrier (U.K. Warrier) was and is my role model even today. He was a good man whose goodness made him great, and this goodness is recognized not only by his immediate family but strangers even to this day – years after his death. When I was young, he used to tell me "you must decide if you want to be one among ten or one among nine". He went on to explain in his inimitable patient style. Let's say there are ten horses in a horse race. Only one horse among the ten will finish first. The rest are among the nine left behind. So you have to decide where you want to end up at. It took me years to understand. My father was not only one among ten, but I would say he was one among millions. Here is his story.

My father was the 8th child (among 9); as such he was named Krishna with reference to the story of Lord Krishna who was born as the eighth child. He had three elder brothers and was the youngest male child. Therefore, later on in life, he came to be known as "Kuttiman" (little uncle) by his nephews and nieces. This is a moniker that stuck. He became Kuttiman to many. He also had five sisters, one of whom was younger to him.

As was the common practice in those days, he grew up in a joint family in Ukkath Variam on the banks of the river Bharata puzha in Thiruvilwamala (close to the towns of Shoranur and Ottappalam). Thiruvilwamala is a hilly village in the Thrissur district of Kerala state in South India. It is famous as a temple town as the site of the Vilwadrinatha temple where the presiding deity is Lord Rama. Variars (also known as Warriers) are closely associated with temple activities; so it was natural for my father to also be a regular at the temple. As a young boy, he was very active, intelligent and always interested in his studies. Often, he would climb trees to pluck mangoes and distribute them to his friends.

## Early Life: Courage and Faith
As a young boy, my father exhibited extraordinary courage and faith which later became his hallmark. In one instance, there was an incident of a supposed demon plaguing a pregnant lady in the village. The woman's husband was away and she was frightened by the sounds she heard at night. My father volunteered to help stay guard. At night, there were sounds and he heard someone call out the lady's husband's name. My father thought to himself, "if it a demon, surely he must know my name and that I am here instead of her husband". He decided that it was a human playing a prank and came out to investigate. Sure enough, there was a person (who was known as a village madcap) throwing stones into the well to create sounds and shouting the husband's name. In this way, my father exposed the 'so-called demon'. On another occasion, on a bet, he declared to his friends that he would spend the night in the cremation ground. He did so without any fear and won ₹1 (a huge amount in those days). In such ways, even as a lad, he did not flinch from anything.

He completed his SSLC exams and stood first. He wanted to continue for higher studies. In those days, the future was often decided by maternal uncles. My father was told by his uncle that he could not afford for my father to continue for higher studies and that his only option was to work in the fields. My father decided that he wanted a different life and so decided to run away at the age of 15. With the help of a friend, he left the Variam with a few rupees in his pocket with a promise to his parents that he would be back with a degree. Originally, he wanted to join the army but being too short (my father was only about 5'5"), he did not qualify. So he decided to seek some other opportunity.

## Journey to Calcutta
He and friend got on a train from Shoranur going toward Erode. Unfortunately, in the night the friend ran away taking away all of my father's money. My father was left with little than the clothes he had on in Erode. On the way, he met a Sanyasi who was asking for alms. My father took the shirt off his back and gave it to him. Then he got another train going to Trichy. The guard came by and asked for the ticket. Since he didn't have one, he was thrown off the train. My father fell on a stack of coal. He got up, dusted himself and started on a journey, walking towards the famous Trichy temple. It took him about five days. He barely kept himself alive, drinking water from the roadside fountains whenever he was hungry.

Eventually, he reached the temple. He knew that he would get some food from the temple as 'prasad'. As good fortune would have it, he saw the same Sanyasi he had given his shirt to earlier. The Sanyasi also recognized the boy and took him into his care. This was a turning point in my father's life. The Sanyasi gave my father some food which he promptly vomited because he had not had anything for a while. In due course, the Sanyasi nursed him back to health. The Sanyasi also taught my father skills like how to read palms and faces. In this way, my father earned about ₹40. Someone told him that there were better opportunities in Bangalore. So he decided to leave Trichy and head north to Bangalore.

He first landed near Lal Bagh, a famous location in the city. There he had to sleep on the cold Cuddapah stones with hardly anything to cover. Somehow, he managed to get a job as a bus cleaner and later 'graduated' to become a bus conductor. He managed to earn enough to stay in a lodge. With the encouragement and help of some coworkers, he managed to learn driving. Unfortunately, one day a bus got damaged. His colleagues advised him to leave as the owner could be very abusive. So he left and looked for something else. He found a job as a waiter. However, it was a place that served drinks. Despite easy access to alcohol, he never drank. One day, he was serving a policeman from Kerala. The policeman noticed the boy and recognizing a possible familiar face, made inquiries of my father. The policeman came to know about my father's story. As the policeman was also originally from around my father's native place, he decided to help the boy. He wrote to my father's brother and also offered my father to stay with him a while. My father's brother received the policeman's letter and immediately sent some money via money order requesting him to come back home. My father agreed to go his brother in Calicut (Kozhikode), but not back to Thiruvalamala. He wanted to only return after he had earned a degree. In Calicut, he got a job as a lineman, and later in the newspaper "Mathurbhumi".

Meanwhile, another brother in Calcutta (Kolkatta) encouraged my father to come up there. So my father went further north to Calcutta. This began the start of his love for that city, a place he would spend more than 30 years of his life. After he came to Calcutta, he started taking evening classes to study. In this way, he eventually completed degrees in both commerce and law (B.Com, and B.L.). He started working at Grand James Furniture. He was very hardworking and bright, so he moved up the ranks to eventually become the Managing Director. Later, my mother used to say that after marriage when she used to visit the factory, she would see workers with pictures of my father. She began to inquire why? They showed their love and respect for him and used to say, "Ye Devar Hai" (he is like God).

## Marriage and Family
By the time he was 30, my father was in a good position with a degree. So he kept his promise to go back to Kerala and meet his parents. He met his mother after nearly 14 years. His mother could hardly recognize him because of all the changes in his appearance. Anyhow, she was very happy. She then encouraged him to get married. However, my father was not keen. It was the days of the world war, and he saw many refugees come to Calcutta from Burma (Myanmar). Seeing all the suffering, he was not sure about married life. Nevertheless, his mother eventually prevailed. Through a mutual friend, he was introduced to my mother's family. He finally agreed to get married to my mother. Years later, he would tell that when he looked at my mother's photo that he felt she would be the most compatible. He used his skills in reading faces and palms that he learnt long ago from the Sanyasi in Trichy.

In this way, life progressed in Calcutta. There were religious riots and my parents sheltered families without regard to caste or religion. My elder brother was born and my parents started to form roots in Calcutta. They had a good circle of friends and my father's life started to improve from the early days of his hardship. However, things at Grand James took a different turn when my father had differences of opinion on how things should be run concerning his core values. He had to leave with little to show for his work. At that time, he had contacts with another company, Gillanders Arbuthnot. My father got an opportunity in the Kalamazoo business division making binders and accessories to manage business processes and accounting (this was in the days before computerization).

## Bombay and Business Wisdom
<img src={picTeaching.src} alt="Profile of young U.K. Warrier teaching on blackboard" style="float: right; max-width: 250px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
The opportunity took him and the family to Bombay (Mumbai). Here he started growing the company and was able to sell products to many firms, particularly to banks. Some of the business forms for ledgers are used in banks even today. My father developed a gift for selling. His honesty and scruples gave him creditability among his clients, as well as colleagues and superiors. My father used to be fond of catchphrases to make his point. He would say, "There is a difference between selling and telling". If you are telling, you are only talking about the product. Selling really means showing why the product is valuable to the customer. He also used to say, "Selling begins when the customer says 'no'". He meant that you have to work harder to overcome objections but put yourself in what the customer wants to achieve. He used to also say "Selling is the job where there is no limit to your income potential". Like this, he used to share wisdom with not only us (his children) but also his co-workers. Later, he used to provide sales training to many young recruits in the company.

<img src={picCar.src} alt="Profile of young U.K. Warrier in a car" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
When our family was in Bombay, I (second son) as born. One of the major events that happened in my father's life was how he came in contact with Baba. There was a friend who took him to Shirdi. There he met the old lady, Lakshmi Bhai (who is mentioned in the Sai Satchirita). Baba before His passing gave Lakshmi Bhai the gift of 9 coins. It is believed that these coins symbolized the nine forms of devotion. Laksmi Bhai asked my father to make three wishes that would come true. His first wish was a car of his own, which did come true shortly after. I don't recollect the second wish. But the third one was to meet a great spiritual personality. This also came true when he (and all of our family) met Sri Sathya Sai Baba many years later.

A few years later, my father got transferred back to Calcutta. He was very happy to go back as Calcutta had a special place in his heart. Through Gillanders, he got an opportunity to go to the United Kingdom for a few months of training. My mother was able to also join him for some time. There used to be an Englishman, Mr. Cooper who used to be quite tough on everyone, including my father. After the training, there was a party. Mr. Cooper came up to my mother and said, "Mrs. Warrier, your husband surprised me. This little man used to come and sit quietly in the classes. I used to wonder if he was absorbing anything. But he came first!". After that, Mr. Cooper had great admiration for my father.

## Meeting Sri Sathya Sai Baba
Life continued in Calcutta. Here, my father now got in contact with Sri Sathya Sai Baba (whom we call as "Swami"). There used to be bhajan singing in Geeta Bhavan. My family started attending. Even now, I remember going there as a small boy. There was an incident involving my health where the 'hand of Baba' was clearly evident. From that day, my parents' faith in Baba became firm.

In the late 60s, my father got transferred to Madras. In the early 70s, our family used to frequently start visiting Puttaparthi. In those days, going from Madras to Puttaparthi was a huge affair, as the journey was long and not easy especially travelling the 'kucha' roads towards the end. Nevertheless, we went with anticipation to have Swami's darshan. We were willing to undergo all of the physical discomforts because of the solace and peace we felt. And so, started several journeys to Parthi and our family's connection to Swami.

## Kottakkal Years: Trials and Triumphs
By the mid-70s, my father's name had spread among the Warrier community as a person of integrity and hard work. He had helped so many people come up. Our place is Madras was often a stopover point for family members on their way to Kerala from up north, and vice-versa. We also had relatives stay over, using our home as a base. My father's nickname of "Kuttiman" had become well known not only among his nieces and nephews but among many friends and members of the community. And so it was that around the mid-70s, he came in contact with P.K. Warrier of Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala through a mutual connection with VK Eradi (related to a former judge Balakrishna Eradi, who also a follower of Sai Baba). P.K. Warrier wanted my father to join as the general manager. At first, he was hesitant to leave Madras but finally, he agreed.

<img src={picDesk2.src} alt="Profile of older U.K. Warrier at his desk" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
In Kottakkal, he brought about many changes to improve the factory applying his business process skills from the Kalamazoo days. He was able to successfully invite the then Prime Minister to visit the factory and draw positive attention to the benefits of Ayurveda and Kottakkal's contribution to Ayurveda. He also started a canteen for the benefit of the workers. He then started a herbal garden for growing several of the unique plants and herbs that were used in medicines. He started a lab. He was a patron of the arts, having a special fondness for Kathakali. He was instrumental in having Kottakkal's Kathakali troop perform in front of Sai Baba in Puttaparthi. He also made several changes to improve operations of the plant and to plug many holes which were causing the factory to leak money through a combination of inefficient and illicit means. For example, there were irregular means of procuring raw materials that were used to siphon off money.

Not everyone appreciated the changes. Some individuals who had been using company resources for personal gain found their activities curtailed by my father's reforms. Certain elements, feeling threatened, wanted to harm my father. They hatched a plan to surround my father's car as he was travelling from our home to the factory in Kottakkal. On the destined day, my father had a Baba dream where he got 'padanamskar'. He used to wake up early anyway (normally around 4:00 am). That day, he was awoken by the dream around 3:00 am. He had a premonition of what was going to happen but he had faith that he would be protected. My mother packed some "Complan" powder so that he could carry small packets in his belt. Then early in the morning, before anybody could do anything, he walked all the way from home to the office. He did not take the car. With the Grace of God, no one recognized him. He safely got to the office. When the instigators came to surround the car, they realized that their plan had been foiled.

Then they continued their agitations and proceeded to 'gherao' my father and the Managing Trustee, PK Warrier. They went on shouting and carrying placards; some even had knives and axes and other instruments to inflict harm. The situation continued for several hours. Throughout, my father was calm. Finally, he agreed to speak directly to the protesters. He opened the door and said, "You want to kill me. Why? If I die for your sake, then maybe I have done something positive in my life. I am not afraid of death. You know that I have already written my name in the smashanam (cremation ground… recounting the story as a boy)". Like this, he spoke fearlessly to the crowd of agitators and listened to their demands. He agreed to implement changes that were fair and beneficial to all such as some additional allowances. But he did not back down from his principles. After a long day, cooler heads prevailed and the crowd of demonstrators finally agreed to let my father return home.

Such problems continued for a while. On another occasion when my parents were about to go to Puttaparthi, a group surrounded the car and said "We will not let you leave. Let us see if your Baba is powerful so that you can reach Puttparthi". My parents stayed in the car and prayed to Swami. Again, things eventually calmed and the car was allowed to depart for Puttaparthi. My parents were able to safely reach there and have Swami's darshan.

Despite all the issues, my father continued to only work for the greater good. He took up a case against the factory that had been languishing for several years. He had to travel often from Kottakkal to Eranakulam, site of the State High Court. On one of these occasions, my parents got into a bad accident. Fortunately, the 'unseen hand' of God was with them that day and they were able to survive with very little effects. The case was referred to the Supreme Court. My father went to Delhi. Before the judgment was passed, my father felt the presence of Sai Baba in the room, as if Swami was guiding the proceedings. Soon after, he got the news that the case had been decided in favor of Kottakkal. In this way, with Baba's blessing, he was able to prevail for the benefit of the institution. Once in an interview with Swami, my father broke down in tears. He said, "Despite so many efforts, I face many challenges in Kottakkal". Baba replied, "I know. I know. There is a lot of jealousy. But, I am with you. Why fear when I am here?". And so He gave my father courage.

## Final Years: Return to Madras

After about 7 years in Kottakkal, my father decided to return to Madras. When he got back, Gillanders was willing to take him back. They said, "We were not able to find anyone like you all this time!". My father offered to give training to the young recruits. He also became quite active in the Ayyappa Temple in Nungambakkam. Every day, he would wake up early in the morning and after his morning formalities and prayers would regularly go to the temple. He would often be there as the priests were just starting to open up for morning pooja! He would circumambulate the deity several times, saying that it would have the dual benefit of both spiritual and physical well-being. He was quite active and all of his work (at the temple and the training) for free. By this time, my father was into the 80s and he didn't want to work for a salary. He also started writing his thoughts about the Bhagawad Gita and compiled a huge volume of notes. After completing the Gita, he started on "Srimad Bhagavatam".

My parents were planning to visit me in the U.S. But my father's heart – and destiny – was always in India. And so as destiny would have it, my father passed away before those plans could materialize. He died a peaceful death at night, with my mother by his side.

## Legacy
And so came to end the final chapter of his life. But his story lives on – not so much in these words, but in our memories and our hearts. My father taught me many things. Above all, he taught me fearlessness and persistence. He used to be fond of recounting an incident from the mythological story of the churning of the ocean of milk by the Devas and the Asuras looking for the nectar of eternal life. In the story, the first thing that came out of the ocean was poison. Then, there followed many other secondary things such as good health, wealth, etc. But the ultimate objective was nectar. My father used to make the point: if you are after the nectar of immortality, then go after it. Be committed to it. Don't stop till you reach it. In the beginning, you may get some failures, just like the poison came out first. You may also get distracted by things that are apparently attractive but not long-lasting. You must continue till you get to your objective which is everlasting success. You must be courageous to get there. Even today, when life's challenges come and I feel buffeted by troubles I remember my father. I recall all the troubles he went through and how he met his challenges. That gives me the strength to go on. Truly, his life was an exemplary message to the entire family for generations.

## Epilogue
<img src={picTribute.src} alt="Poem written as tribute by young nephew" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />

Perhaps the best example of his generational impact is the beautiful poem written by my nephew right after my father's death. He wrote this at the age of 13. The poem is self-explantory about the impression that my dad left on his young mind.
