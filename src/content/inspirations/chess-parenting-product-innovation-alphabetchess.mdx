I want to acknowledge Vishnu Warrier and his wife Lilia Warrier for achieving an incredible milestone—AlphaBetChess reaching #1 in the New Release category for Children's Boardgames on Amazon! To break from the typical "proud dad" post, I'd like to share some lessons Vishnu and I have discovered on how chess, parenting, and product management are intertwined. We have explored these connections in our collaboration *Mantras for Product Managers: Axioms, One-liners, and Pithy Sayings every PM should know.*

The parallels between these domains run deeper than one might imagine, with each requiring strategic thinking, adaptability, and a long-term vision.

## The Beginning

To take a step back, Vishnu's chess journey began on Christmas Eve. A family friend wanted to get a Christmas gift for Vishnu when he was a toddler. But the stores were closed, and the only open corner drugstore had a chessboard. My wife and I taught him the basics, but he soon showed a deeper interest beyond our capacity. Then, at a tournament in Houston, Vishnu and his school team secured a huge win among the other competing schools. The rest is history.

## Key Observations from This Journey

### The Zugzwang Principle and Patient Growth

In pawn endings, every move carries lasting consequences that may only become apparent many moves later. I've spent countless hours silently watching his tournament games, resisting the urge to intervene when seeing potential mistakes. This same principle of calculated restraint now guides my approach to product management, where the temptation to immediately "fix" things must be balanced against letting teams develop their own problem-solving capabilities.

### From Player to Teacher

The transition from player to coach and entrepreneur brings unique insights. As Product Management Guru Rich Mironov notes in his discussion of parenting and product management, there's no substitute for real-world experience. Vishnu's development of AlphaBetChess demonstrates this evolution—understanding that teaching chess isn't just about moves and tactics, but about making complex ideas accessible and engaging. His methodical approach includes waking up at 4 AM to study chess. He has learned to balance this with his tech consulting job and family commitments. Waking up early is a tradition that I have passed along to him from my dad.

### Strategic Time Management and Innovation

Just as chess requires careful tracking of improvement through systematic study, product development demands meticulous planning and prioritization. The success of educational tools like AlphaBetChess shows how complex concepts can be transformed into accessible learning experiences. This process mirrors the product manager's challenge of bridging technical capabilities with user needs.

### Cross-Domain Learning

What's most fascinating is how these domains inform each other. Chess principles—thinking ahead, maintaining flexibility, balancing multiple threats—translate effectively to business planning and family life. Meanwhile, product management concepts like MVP (Minimum Viable Product) thinking enhance chess education approaches. This cross-pollination of ideas has proven valuable in both chess instruction and product development.

### Support Systems and Success

None of these achievements would have been possible without strong family support, particularly from Lilia's unwavering encouragement. This reflects a universal truth across chess, product management, and family life—no one succeeds alone. The journey from that Christmas gift chess set to becoming an author, entrepreneur, and chess coach while maintaining a successful tech career demonstrates how proper planning and support enable the pursuit of multiple passions while maintaining professional and family commitments.

## Full Circle

Watching AlphaBetChess climb to #1 reminds me of those early tournament days—the same focus, determination, and joy in sharing chess with others continue to drive success. The hours spent waiting outside tournament halls have yielded unexpected lessons in patience, strategy, and the delicate balance between guidance and independence—lessons that resonate across parenting, product management, and chess alike.
