    <!-- =========================
         Welcome Introduction
    ========================== -->
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      My journey spans many roles—engineer, product leader, inventor, author, mentor, philanthropist, and spiritual aspirant. 
      Technology and industry shaped my career, but service, community, and inner inquiry have shaped my life’s journey since childhood. 
      I follow the teachings of <a href="https://www.srisathyasai.org/pages/index.html">Sri Sathya Sai Baba</a>, whose guidance to “Love All, Serve All” and “Help Ever, Hurt Never” 
      continues to influence how I build, teach, and contribute.
    </p>

    <p>
      My roots trace back to Kerala, and the idea of a traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadya">“Onam Sadhya”</a> offers a useful way to think about my vision for this site:
      a single leaf holding many distinct elements—technical work, reflective writing, institutional service—
      juxtaposed with intent. It reflects variety, not fragmentation; coherence without uniformity. Like the Sadhya’s flavors—sweet, salty, spicy, bitter—life’s lessons come in many forms, all to be cherished.

        Seva Section
    ========================== -->
    <section class="home-section">
      <h2>Seva — Service to Man Is Service to God</h2>

      <p>
        In medicine, service is embedded into the profession. Engineering is different. We build systems that shape the world, 
        yet the deeper question is what we choose to do with that capability. Over time, that question led me toward community service—a turning point from personal achievement to shared upliftment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, much of my effort is directed toward sustainable AI, climate-resilient technologies, student mentorship, 
        and long-term institution building at my alma mater, the 
        <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK)</a>.
        This includes supporting research ecosystems, enabling AI excellence centers, and strengthening entrepreneurial networks. It also means
        creating pathways for young engineers to learn, lead, and serve with integrity—humility in approach and confidence in purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe that technology is most meaningful when it expands opportunity and dignity—not just efficiency or profit. 
        Seva, in this context, is a practice: contributing knowledge, opening doors, and investing in people who will carry the work forward.
      </p>

      <p><em>Begin here if you seek:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>institutional service and capacity-building</li>
        <li>mentorship that scales beyond individuals</li>
        <li>technology aligned with human and environmental well-being</li>

         Ideas Section
    ========================== -->
    <section class="home-section">
      <h2>Ideas — Inner and Outer Inquiry</h2>

      <p>
        This space brings together many strands of thinking: technology and culture, systems and stories, 
        ancient knowledge structures and modern AI. It also holds memoir and memory—humorous reflections from my book 
        <em>Once Upon a Time in KREC</em> and other lived experiences that shaped who I have become.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some writings look outward: essays on AI, regenerative design, and the patterns that repeat across eras. 
        Others look inward: observations on leadership, learning, spirituality, and the humor and chaos of campus life. 
        Not everything here is definitive. Some pieces are meant to endure; others are simply thinking aloud. 
        The point is exploration, not certainty.
      </p>

      <p><em>Begin here if you want:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>technology and philosophy in conversation</li>
        <li>stories from KREC campus life and long journeys home</li>
        <li>patterns that reveal meaning across eras and disciplines</li>
        <li>humor and memory alongside method and rigor</li>

         Work Section

    <section class="home-section">
      <h2>Work — Digital Transformation at Scale</h2>
      <p>
        Across four decades, the tools changed constantly but the questions remained:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do you build at scale and transform organizations without losing the human?</li>
        <li>What holds when the playbook doesn’t exist?</li>
        <li>How do constraints breed better systems?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This section describes and documents decisions made under pressure, leadership lessons learned across industries, 
        and entrepreneurial wisdom gained from both successes and failures.
      </p>

      <p><em>Begin here if you value:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>engineering reality shaped by era-specific constraints</li>
        <li>leadership forged through actual tradeoffs, not theory</li>
        <li>entrepreneurship and innovation in complex environments</li>

         Inspiration Section
    ========================== -->
    <section class="home-section">
      <h2>Inspiration — People, Places & Possibilities</h2>

      <p>
        No life is built alone. The ideas and systems I work on are shaped by the people who raised me, 
        the cultures I have lived within, and the thinkers and creators who continue to challenge and expand my view of what is possible. 
        This space exists to honor those influences.
      </p>

      <p>
        My parents shaped my worldview long before technology did—kindness as strength, discipline without hardness, 
        humor in difficulty, and the belief that learning never ends. Much of what I attempt now is, in some way, homage to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        My parents led me to spiritual inquiry, including a close association with Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Since early childhood, His teachings continue to shape how I think about purpose, leadership, and the role of technology in serving people with compassion and dignity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the spiritual, inspiration arrives from many directions: world leaders who navigated uncertainty with clarity,  
        technology pioneers who imagined possibilities before the tools existed, and poets who reveal the inner architecture of emotion 
        through language and rhythm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Travel has also been its own university. From Australia to Zambia, and many places in between, landscapes, food, conversations, and 
        cultural traditions have widened my sense of belonging. I find wisdom in discussions shared over chai as much as in research labs or boardrooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Books, essays, poetry, talks, and films will live here—works that continue to inspire, provoke, and comfort. 
        Some are foundational classics; others are unexpected discoveries that have changed my thinking in small but profound ways.
      </p>

      <p><em>Begin here if you’re curious about:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>the people and experiences that shaped my worldview</li>
        <li>guidance from Sri Sathya Sai Baba and other spiritual influences</li>
        <li>books, poetry, and ideas that stayed with me</li>
        <li>travel and food memories across cultures and countries</li>
        <li>technologists, leaders, and thinkers who expanded possibility</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A Lifelong Learner’s Note</h2>
      <p>
        I seek inspiration from a Sanskrit verse that resonates with my beliefs about knowledge and wisdom.
      </p>

      <div class="sanskrit-line">
        आचार्यात् पादमादत्ते पादं शिष्यः स्वमेधया ।

        One quarter of knowledge comes from teachers, one quarter from self-study, 
        one quarter from peers, and the final quarter through time.
