## The Pattern

I've spent decades moving between places.

Across the United States—coast to coast, north to south, through middle America. Across India—from Delhi to Kanyakumari, Mumbai to Kolkata. And repeatedly into Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

During my college days, I would sit on the parapet wall of a temple overlooking the Arabian Sea. It was a place to meditate and wonder what lay beyond the blue waters. That wonder eventually took me to America.

What followed was decades of boundary-crossing. Technology work took me into conference rooms, engineering floors, and executive reviews around the world. Service work took me into schools, institutions, and communities building capability that would last. Spiritual practice kept me returning to temples across India and the US, and to quieter corners where continuity mattered more than movement.

At some point I noticed the pattern. This wasn't about living in one place and traveling occasionally. It was about operating across boundaries as a normal condition. Deep engagement in the U.S. and India, with repeated presence elsewhere. Long enough in some places to absorb the nuances—not just sights and sounds, but the rhythms of daily life, the unspoken assumptions, the cultural logic beneath the surface.

When you go deep enough, places start teaching you things—not through tourism's surface impressions, but through the slower work of noticing what you assumed was universal.

## When Familiar Arguments Fall Away

Early in my Microsoft career, I learned this lesson directly. In a senior review, I dismissed an idea as "too costly" and was challenged to argue it on fundamentals instead. I couldn't. That moment stayed with me—not because of the interruption, but because it exposed how easily we hide behind familiar constraints when the harder work is to reason clearly under pressure. That failure eventually led me to <Link href="/inspirations/works/jerry-weissman-two-books">Jerry Weissman's books</Link> on presentation and Q&A—not for speaking tips, but for frameworks on thinking clearly under fire.

Over time, moving across cultures and organizations made that tendency easier to spot—first in others, eventually in myself.

## What the Data Didn't Explain

Years later, during the Hotmail years at Microsoft, we noticed something odd. Mailboxes in Mexico and Spain were significantly larger than those elsewhere. There was nothing unusual in terms of spam or abuse. Just… bigger inboxes.

So we went to see.

What we observed was simple. It was common to share large files—presentations about nature, spiritual reflections, political commentary. The same attachments were sent repeatedly to large distribution lists. Storage grew, not because of misuse, but because sharing itself was a social act.

The pattern was immediately familiar. In India, forwarding messages—images, greetings, "good morning" notes—is common. Not as noise, but as connection.

That recognition changed the solution. This wasn't a user-education problem. It was an architectural one. We redesigned how attachments were handled and integrated mailbox storage more tightly with shared repositories so the same file didn't need to be duplicated across every inbox.

The lesson stayed with me: data tells you what is happening. Context tells you why.

## "Normal" Is a Local Idea

The original Xbox controllers were designed around what we assumed was a normal user. They worked well in the U.S. They failed badly in Japan. The controllers were simply too large to be comfortable.

There was no clever reframing. Just the realization that "normal" was local.

We redesigned.

That experience reinforced something I'd seen elsewhere: products often fail across boundaries not because users are wrong, but because assumptions went unexamined.

## Things You Learn Without Being Taught

Once, while traveling in Brazil, I hid money in my socks. A colleague was surprised. He didn't expect that from someone visiting from the U.S. He asked how I knew to do it.

"I learned it in India," I said.

That kind of knowledge isn't written down. It's learned by paying attention—by watching how people move through risk, trust, and daily life. And once learned, it travels.

## What Service Work Slowed Down for Me

In Zambia, we worked on building computer labs in schools without reliable electricity. I arrived with technical expertise and project discipline. Both were useful. Neither was sufficient.

What mattered more was sitting with teachers, understanding constraints, and building local capability instead of delivering a solution and moving on. The work required patience and an explicit plan for absence from the beginning.

That approach didn't come from one place. It came from many—from Indian service work, from American volunteer communities, and from everywhere I'd seen people build things meant to outlast their involvement.

## Belonging, Expanded

Travel didn't make me a "citizen of the world." I've never liked that phrase. It suggests belonging nowhere.

What happened instead was quieter. My sense of belonging expanded. India through family and spiritual practice. The U.S. through decades of work and community. Hawaii through its sacred geography. Zambia through sustained service relationships.

These commitments didn't compete. They layered.

That turns out to matter in modern work. Most leadership today happens across overlapping contexts—matrix organizations, cross-functional teams, global initiatives. You're constantly navigating different assumptions about time, risk, authority, and success.

## Still Learning

The list of places is just geography. What matters are the moments that changed how I thought—the times when dashboards didn't explain behavior, when assumptions failed quietly, when listening mattered more than expertise.

Travel continues to be an education. Not because of movement, but because every new context forces you to examine what you're carrying without noticing.

Over time, it's not credentials that accumulate. It's capacity. The capacity to move between contexts. To notice patterns. To adapt without losing center. To remain useful when the situation isn't familiar.

That's the geography that's stayed with me.
