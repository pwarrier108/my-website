        <h1>Values</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Technical decisions are never purely technical. They embed values—about what matters, what we optimize for, who we serve, what we preserve. These are the principles that have guided decisions across eras.
        </p>

        <section class="home-section">
            <h2>Fundamentals Matter</h2>
            <p>Trends come and go. Architectures evolve. But fundamental principles—reliability, clarity, maintainability, respect for constraints—persist. When in doubt, return to fundamentals.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="home-section">
            <h2>Humanity First</h2>
            <p>Technology serves people, not the other way around. Systems that ignore human context, human limitations, or human dignity are failures regardless of their technical sophistication.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="home-section">
            <h2>Systems Are Ecosystems</h2>
            <p>No system exists in isolation. Every technical decision creates ripples—organizational, environmental, social. Responsible building means accounting for the ecosystem, not just the artifact.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="home-section">
            <h2>Knowledge Transfer Is Duty</h2>
            <p>What we learned came from those who took time to teach. Passing that knowledge forward—with context, with honesty about failures, with respect for the next generation's different constraints—is not optional. It is obligation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="home-section">
            <h2>Spiritual Grounding</h2>
            <p>Technical work does not exist apart from larger questions of meaning, service, and purpose. My spiritual practice, grounded in the teachings of Sri Sathya Sai Baba, provides the ethical foundation that shapes not just what I build, but why and for whom.</p>
            <p>Service, compassion, and responsibility are not abstractions—they are guiding principles that inform every decision, from system architecture to institutional commitment.</p>
