*NITK's beach at dawn has always had a special place in my heart.*

During my college years, I would go there early and sit on the parapet wall of the temple overlooking the Arabian Sea. It was quiet, but not empty. The water moved steadily. The air smelled of salt. The day hadn’t started yet, but it was clearly on its way. Sitting on the sands of Surathkal, I found myself thinking better at that hour—less distracted, less hurried, more attentive to what was in front of me.

Years later, standing by the waters of Waikola in Hawaii, I noticed the same thing. Different ocean, different continent, different stage of life—but a familiar mental state. The same sense of steadiness. The same feeling that clarity came not from effort, but from waiting long enough for it to take shape.

Only over time did I understand what connected those moments. It wasn’t nostalgia or coincidence. It was the realization that discernment often forms in places that slow you down—where movement continues without pressure, and the mind has space to notice what matters before deciding what to do next.

I have spent much of my life moving between places. Across the United States—coast to coast, including midwestern regions shaped by very different assumptions about work, risk, and ambition. Across India—from its largest cities to its quieter nooks. And beyond, into Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

At some point, I realized this wasn’t about travel in the usual sense. It wasn’t about seeing new places or accumulating experiences. It was about operating across boundaries as a normal condition. Deep engagement in the United States and India, with repeated travel elsewhere—long enough for novelty to fade and for deeper differences to surface. Not the differences you notice immediately, but the ones that quietly challenge what you assumed was universal.

That is where discernment begins to take shape.

## India: Learning to Move with Constraint and Change

*India places the reality of change front and center.*

There is an understanding that conditions will evolve. That expectation doesn’t dilute intent; it sharpens it. Work moves forward because purpose is held steady even as paths adjust. Motion is normal. Completion still matters.

What I absorbed there was *jugaad* as pragmatism—the ability to keep the goal intact while allowing methods to evolve. It is the habit of asking how to finish with what is available, rather than postponing action in search of ideal conditions. Progress comes not from resisting variability, but from carrying purpose through it.

That way of thinking does something important to the mind. It quiets anxiety around uncertainty. It shifts attention away from variance and back to outcome. It makes flexibility compatible with responsibility.

I didn’t recognize this as learning while it was happening. It became visible later—when work elsewhere stalled because people waited for stability that never arrived, or when progress depended less on debating what should be and more on completing what needed to be done.

## The United States: Learning to Pause When It Matters

*If India taught me how to move forward with adaptability, the United States taught me how to pause—deliberately, and at the right moments.*

In professional environments shaped by engineering culture and rigorous debate, I encountered a consistent discipline around intellectual honesty. Arguments were expected to rest on fundamentals. Assumptions were examined rather than defended. Effort alone did not justify continuation.

Over time, I learned to separate what mattered from what merely sounded impressive. To let weak reasoning fall away without personal attachment. To recognize when stopping—or not proceeding—was the more responsible choice.

This discipline wasn’t about being right. It was about doing what mattered. About resisting sunk costs and familiar explanations when the underlying logic no longer held.

Combined with what I carried from India, it created balance: forward motion without self-deception, rigor without paralysis.

## When Context Changes the Answer

Some lessons only become clear when context refuses to cooperate with data.

While working on Hotmail at Microsoft, we noticed something unexpected. Mailboxes in certain countries—Spain and parts of Latin America, in particular—were significantly larger than elsewhere. There was no spike in spam or abuse. From dashboards alone, nothing appeared wrong.

So we went to see.

What we found wasn’t a technical anomaly, but a social one. Sharing documents—presentations, reflections, messages—was less about efficiency and more about connection. Files were sent repeatedly not because users misunderstood storage, but because repetition itself reinforced relationship. Once we saw that, the solution shifted. This wasn’t a user-education problem. It was an architectural one. We redesigned how attachments were handled so systems reflected how people actually interacted.

*Data told us what was happening. Local culture explained why.*

Another lesson arrived more bluntly. An early Xbox controller worked well in the United States but failed badly in Japan. The design assumed a “normal” user that turned out to be very local. The controller functioned exactly as specified. It simply didn’t fit comfortably in the hands that held it.

There was no reframing that solved this. Only redesign.

Those experiences stayed with me because they revealed something easy to miss: defaults don’t announce themselves. They hide inside assumptions, and geography is often what exposes them.

*“Normal,” I learned, is always local.*

## Knowledge That Travels Quietly

*Some knowledge is absorbed so gradually that you forget where it came from.*

Once, while traveling in Brazil, I was about to enter a crowded market when I shifted some cash out of my wallet and into my socks, almost without noticing I was doing it. A colleague noticed and asked how I knew that was necessary. I told him I had learned it years earlier in India—simply by observing how people moved through uncertainty and risk.

That kind of knowledge doesn’t announce itself. It settles into habit, ready to surface when conditions feel familiar, even if the location is not.

This is how learning matures—instinctively, as second nature.

## What Service Work Clarified

In Zambia, working on computer labs in schools without reliable electricity, I arrived confident in plans and process. Both were useful. Neither was sufficient.

What mattered more was patience. Sitting with teachers. Understanding constraints that were never written down. Building local capability rather than delivering solutions dependent on continued external presence.

That approach didn’t come from one place. It emerged over time—from service work in India, from volunteer communities in the United States, and from seeing projects fail when continuity was assumed instead of designed.

*Reliance and resilience, I learned, must be considered from the beginning.*

## Viveka, Arriving Slowly

Only much later did I recognize what had been forming.

In Indian philosophy, viveka refers to discernment—the capacity to distinguish what matters from what distracts, to combine judgment with clarity and restraint. Lived experience teaches it slowly. Not through instruction, but through accumulation. Through repeated exposure to consequence, adjustment, and responsibility.

Travel didn’t make me a “citizen of the world.” I’ve never been comfortable with that phrase. It suggests belonging nowhere.

What happened instead was quieter. My sense of belonging expanded. India through family, memory, and spiritual practice. The United States through decades of work and community. Other places through sustained engagement rather than brief contact.

These commitments didn’t compete. They layered.

From that layering came steadiness—the ability to enter unfamiliar settings without urgency to impose order, to adapt without losing center, and to carry forward what works without assuming it belongs everywhere.

## Still Learning

The list of places is just geography. What matters are the moments that reshaped how I thought—when data didn’t explain behavior, when assumptions failed quietly, when listening mattered more than expertise.

Over time, it isn’t experience that accumulates. It’s capacity. The capacity to move between contexts. To respect constraint without resentment. To pause when motion is easy. To allow discernment to emerge gradually, rather than forcing conclusions too early.

Whether on the sands of Surathkal or by the waters of Waikola, that is the geography that stayed with me.
