        <p class="section-intro">
            Across four decades, the work has evolved from silicon-layer innovation to cloud-scale systems to sustainable AI. What remains constant: simplifying complexity, building bridges across organizations, and moving technology from potential to impact.

            <h2>The Arc: From Chipsets to Cloud to Sustainable AI</h2>
            <p>The career spans distinct technological eras, each with its own constraints, opportunities, and fundamental questions:</p>
            <p><strong>Telecommunications (1980s-90s):</strong> Building switching systems and infrastructure when reliability and real-time responsiveness were existential requirements, not features.</p>
            <p><strong>Microsoft (2000s):</strong> Scaling web applications from thousands to millions of users, learning how architecture responds when systems encounter their limits.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital Analytics (2010s):</strong> Making sense of massive datasets, building platforms that could handle scale while remaining comprehensible to their users.</p>
            <p><strong>Sustainable AI / NITK (2020s):</strong> Focusing capability on responsibility, asking not just what AI can do, but what it should do under real resource and ethical constraints.</p>

        <section class="home-section">
            <h2>Case Studies</h2>
            <p class="text-muted">Detailed case studies will be added here, documenting specific projects and the decisions made under real constraints. Each case will examine not just what was built, but why it was built that way—the tradeoffs, the context, the learning.</p>
