## Core Concept

Most startups do not fail because they lack talent, capital, or market opportunity. They fail because they do not recognize the failure mode they are in until it is too late to correct.

This framework, originally presented to the inaugural MassChallenge Texas cohort in 2018, identifies three distinct patterns of startup failure and their early warning signs.

## The Three Failure Modes

**Crawls** — You have everything right on paper (vision, team, process, tools) but no momentum. Product is not resonating. Competition just released your must-have feature. You are way too late to market. It feels like being stuck in second gear when you need fifth.

**Stalls** — Investor calls do not convert. Meetings keep getting rescheduled. "Let's have one more meeting." "We'll invest if X invests." Progress has stopped, but you have not realized it yet. The moment calls, but nothing moves.

**Falls** — You have some money, some product, a great team. But little or no traction. Employee attrition begins. The collapse is visible, but often too late to reverse. Slow down before you crash and burn.

## Framework Structure

*[Full framework details to be added]*

Each failure mode includes:
- **Symptoms** — What it looks like when you are in it
- **Causes** — Why it happens (structural, not moral)
- **Solutions** — What might work (with no guarantees)

The goal is not to prevent failure but to normalize it as data—to recognize failure modes early enough to adapt or exit gracefully.

## Context

This presentation was developed from firsthand experience with startup failures and decades of pattern recognition across technology ventures. It was delivered to help founders see that failure is not a moral judgment but a systems outcome—a result of constraints, timing, market dynamics, and decisions made under incomplete information.
