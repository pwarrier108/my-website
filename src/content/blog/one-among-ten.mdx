Growing up, I learned a lot of savvy from my dad. This piece is dedicated to his memory.

My dad had a habit of making pithy statements that stayed with you long after the conversation ended. One day, he asked me, “Do you want to be one among nine or one among ten?”

Seeing my puzzled expression, he continued after a brief pause.

“Imagine there’s a horse race with ten horses, and you are one of the jockeys. Do you want to be one among nine or one among ten?” he repeated.

Then he explained: “Only one horse and rider will win the race. That’s one among ten. The rest are one among nine. You have to decide before you begin why you want to be the jockey who is one among ten.”

It was a lesson that became etched permanently. The idea of committing to a goal from the outset took root early and never left.

There’s a subtle but critical point in what he said. His comment was about the why, not the how. The how adapts to circumstances. The why should not change. If motivation is truly grounded, it should endure. If it doesn’t, the goal itself is likely superficial.

Years later, I made some lifestyle changes around diet and exercise. Those changes have lasted. My exercise routine has not always been steady, but on average, I’ve maintained good health.

Why?

Because my motivation is clear. I love my family, and I want to stay healthy for my sake and for theirs. That motivation pulls me back on track even when I slip. I don’t punish myself for short-term setbacks, because the underlying why keeps asserting itself over time.

The same principle applies to work as well. In fact, my motivations at work and at home are often tied to the same core values—family being one of them.

## Staying Connected to Motivation

So how do I stay connected to my motivations and keep myself aligned? Here’s a process that has worked for me.

### Brainstorm

This is the essential first step. Often, I’m not actually clear about what I want until I write it down. Once or twice a year, I jot down everything I want to accomplish and let ideas flow freely, without filtering.

### Prioritize

Next comes analysis. I separate the list into desires and objectives.

Desires are wishes—things I’d like to do someday, such as visiting New Zealand. Objectives are different. They are goals I’m willing to invest effort in. This is where motivation reveals itself.

Once objectives are clear, I apply time horizons—six months versus five years—and reduce the list to no more than three to five items. Ruthless prioritization is both clarifying and liberating.

### Track

This is the difficult part. It requires honesty. I try not to obsess over daily execution, but if a week goes by without progress on any objective, I know I’ve drifted. That’s when I consciously reconnect with my motivation and self-correct.

### Rinse and Repeat

At least once a year, I return to the brainstorm stage and start fresh. Some objectives remain consistent over time. Others evolve—either because they’ve been accomplished or because they no longer matter.

That evolution, too, is a signal of clarity.

So what’s your formula?

How do you decide why you want to be one among ten?

I’d love to hear.
