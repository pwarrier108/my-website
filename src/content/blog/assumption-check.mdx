You’ve heard the line about assumptions—the one about “u” and “me.” It turns out that checking for assumptions is surprisingly hard to practice.

Why?

Because we constantly “summarize” information in our heads. In the process, details get lost.

Think about it. We receive an enormous amount of input about the world every moment. If we stopped to explicitly test every assumption in real time, daily life would grind to a halt. Instead, we rely on instincts to fill in the picture. That efficiency comes at a cost. In fast-moving conversations—especially in business—we often overlook critical details.

## Nine Common Types of Assumptions

According to work shared by Vervago, there are nine common types of assumptions that show up repeatedly in discussions and decision-making.

### Existence  
An assumption that something or someone exists.  
For example: “This solution will solve the customer satisfaction issue” assumes that a customer satisfaction issue actually exists.

### Uniqueness  
An assumption that there is only one of something—one problem or one solution.  
Clues often appear in words like “this” or “the,” which imply singularity.

### Measurable  
An assumption that something can be accurately measured.  
Customer satisfaction, for example, depends on what is included: product usage, support, pricing, or some combination.

### Possibility  
An assumption that something is feasible.  
Solving a customer satisfaction issue may assume existing resources, budget, and timelines can support the effort.

### Value  
An assumption that the outcome will be valuable.  
Improving customer satisfaction for a product nearing end of life may not be the best use of resources.

### Audience  
An assumption about who the audience is.  
A customer issue may affect only a specific region, segment, or demographic group.

### Category  
An assumption that the issue has been categorized correctly.  
Is the core problem features, pricing, positioning, or something else?

### Similarity  
An assumption that past solutions will apply again.  
Solving a problem for Product X does not guarantee the same approach will work for Product Y.

### Time  
An assumption that conditions remain stable.  
Customer satisfaction drivers can shift over quarters or years—from price, to availability, to performance.

## Practicing Assumption Checks

When preparing for—or listening to—a project review, I now do a quick mental scan across these nine assumption types. The amount of hidden detail that surfaces is remarkable.

Here’s a simple test.

> “After the heist, the masked gunman escaped with the money by running toward the alley for the getaway vehicle waiting for him.”

Read it again. How many assumptions did you make?

Did you picture the alley behind the building?  
Assume the vehicle was a car?  
Assume a single gunman?  
Assume success?

None of those details were stated.
