            Technology careers create capability. How we deploy that capability afterward defines legacy. This section documents institutional service, innovation frameworks, and efforts to help the next generation build better systems.

            <h2>Institutional Endowment</h2>
            <p>In 2020, I established a permanent endowment at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), my alma mater. This was not a one-time donation but a commitment to sustained institutional capacity—funding infrastructure, research, and student support that will compound over decades.</p>
            <p>The endowment supports the creation of an AI Research Centre focused on sustainable computing. Rather than chasing the latest model architectures, the centre examines fundamental questions: How do we build AI systems that remain viable under resource constraints? What does responsible innovation look like when energy costs matter? How do we train the next generation to think beyond capability metrics to systemic impact?</p>
            <p>This is service through infrastructure—creating durable capacity rather than temporary interventions.</p>

            <h2>Warrier H.E.A.R.T. Framework</h2>
            <p>The Warrier H.E.A.R.T. (Holistic, Ethical, Adaptive, Responsible, Transparent) framework emerged from decades of building systems under real constraints. It is not a methodology to be adopted wholesale, but a lens for asking better questions:</p>
            <p><strong>Holistic:</strong> Does the system account for its full context—technical, organizational, environmental, human?</p>
            <p><strong>Ethical:</strong> Whose values are embedded in the design? What tradeoffs were made visible, and which were hidden?</p>
            <p><strong>Adaptive:</strong> Can the system respond to conditions it was not explicitly designed for?</p>
            <p><strong>Responsible:</strong> Does the system acknowledge its impacts beyond immediate functionality?</p>
            <p><strong>Transparent:</strong> Can decisions be traced, understood, and challenged?</p>
            <p>This framework guides the AI Centre's research agenda and shapes how we mentor students. It is a contribution to how we think about innovation, not just what we innovate.</p>

            <h2>Mentoring and Student Support</h2>
            <p>Over the past decade, I have worked directly with student teams, alumni networks, and early-career engineers. The goal is not to replicate my path—the eras have changed too much for that—but to transfer judgment: how to navigate uncertainty, how to recognize when fundamentals matter more than trends, how to build systems that respect constraints rather than ignore them.</p>
            <p>This includes:</p>
            <p><strong>Direct mentoring:</strong> Working with NITK students on research projects, helping them frame questions worth pursuing and understand tradeoffs in system design.</p>
            <p><strong>Alumni engagement:</strong> Reconnecting professional networks across decades, creating bridges between those who built foundational infrastructure and those building on top of it.</p>
            <p><strong>Knowledge transfer:</strong> Writing, speaking, and documenting not just what was built, but why it was built that way—making context visible so future builders can learn from actual constraints, not sanitized success stories.</p>

            <h2>Why Seva Matters</h2>
            <p>A career in technology creates leverage—the ability to affect systems at scale. But leverage without direction is just force. Seva provides direction: using accumulated capability to strengthen institutions, transfer knowledge, and help others build on what came before.</p>
            <p>This is not altruism. It is stewardship. The systems we built were built on top of infrastructure others created. The knowledge we gained came from mentors who took the time. Seva is how we honor that continuity and extend it forward.</p>
            <p>The work continues.</p>
