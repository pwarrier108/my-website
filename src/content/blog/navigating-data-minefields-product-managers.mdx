summary: "Product managers increasingly rely on data, but five critical pitfalls lurk beneath the surface: insufficient context, data hype, algorithm allure, time series complexity, and vendor promises. The solution isn't less data—it's better questions, verified assumptions, and customer-centered discipline."

Product managers increasingly rely on data, but this comes with hidden challenges. Here are five key pitfalls and practical solutions.

## 1. Not Getting Sufficient Context—Ask Critical Questions

**The Pitfall:** Diving into data without a solid grasp of the context is a common mistake that can lead to misguided decisions.

**The Solution:** Embrace Precision Questioning, a framework developed by Vervago. This approach goes beyond basic questions to uncover deeper insights:

**Clarifications:**
- "What specific metrics indicate success for this feature?"
- "Which user segments drive our core growth?"

**Cause and Effect:**
- "What factors contributed to the recent engagement decline?"
- "How will UI changes impact retention rates?"

**Action-related:**
- "Based on our landing page data, what immediate changes should we make?"
- "Which product improvements will best address declining satisfaction?"

## 2. Falling for Data Hype—Check Assumptions

**The Pitfall:** Being seduced by data and making decisions solely based on numbers without validating assumptions can lead to misguided strategies.

**The Solution:** Understand and challenge assumptions using Vervago's 9 categories: Existence, Uniqueness, Measurement, Possibility, Value, Audience, Category, Similarity, and Time/Constant.

**Example:** When observing a surge in user engagement for a fitness app, check:
- Data collection validity
- External influences (like seasonal trends)
- Whether the trend actually benefits your goals

## 3. Allure of Algorithms—Connect with Customers

**The Pitfall:** Becoming captivated by the latest AI or machine learning trends can lead to overly complex solutions that may not address genuine customer needs.

**The Solution:** Prioritize technological choices that align with both business objectives and customer requirements. For example, one of the founders I was advising shifted away from blockchain technology after realizing it introduced unnecessary friction for customer onboarding. But he was centered on his vision of true, verified identities to create zones of trust. Keep your focus on customer-centric goals.

## 4. Challenges of Time Series Analysis—Do Your Math

**The Pitfall:** Time series data, with its patterns and irregularities, requires robust analysis methods.

**The Solution:** Use techniques like:

**Exponential Smoothing:** A method that weights recent data more heavily to identify trends

**ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** Statistical modeling that accounts for trends, seasonality, and random fluctuations

When comparing metrics across different time periods, ensure proper alignment on the time scale. For example, compare Q1 performance year-over-year while accounting for major events or market changes that might affect the comparison. Time-series analysis is a complex subject that requires a keen eye to critically examine data patterns and a solid background in math. Fortunately, there are many solutions out there that make this easier but it doesn't get you off the math hook.

## 5. Promises from Vendors and Internal Teams—Trust but Verify

**The Pitfall:** Vendors and internal teams may present data to align with their interests.

**The Solution:** Adopt a "trust but verify" approach. The best teams I worked with had a discipline of:

- Independently validating vendor data claims
- Cross-referencing multiple data sources
- Documenting verification procedures
- Regular accuracy audits

## Conclusion

By understanding and addressing these common pitfalls, product managers can harness data while remaining context-aware and customer-focused. The key is balancing data insights with practical business needs and customer value.
