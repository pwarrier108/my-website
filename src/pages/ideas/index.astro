        <h1>Ideas — Inner and Outer Inquiry</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Writing here moves between technology and culture, systems and stories, ancient knowledge structures and modern AI. Some writings look outward at patterns across eras. Others look inward at leadership, learning, and memory. Not everything here is definitive—some pieces are meant to endure, others are thinking aloud.

            <h2>TECHNOLOGY & SYSTEMS</h2>
            
            <p>
                Essays on AI, engineering history, platforms, regenerative design, and the patterns that repeat across technological eras. How systems evolve, what fundamentals endure, and where innovation comes from constraint.

            <h2>LEADERSHIP & PRODUCT</h2>
            
            <p>
                Decision-making under uncertainty, communication frameworks, product wisdom forged through real tradeoffs. What it means to build at scale without losing sight of people, and how judgment develops through practice.

            <h2>MEMOIRS & CULTURE</h2>
            
            <p>
                Stories from KREC campus life, travel memories, food and belonging, the humor in chaos, and the cultural textures that shape who we become. Narratives that connect personal history to larger patterns of meaning.

            <h2>PHILOSOPHY & LEARNING</h2>
            
            <p>
                Reflections on spirituality, knowledge transfer, ancient wisdom structures, and the practice of continuous learning. How inner inquiry shapes outer work, and what endures when tools and eras change.
