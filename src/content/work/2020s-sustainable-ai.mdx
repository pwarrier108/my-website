summary: After four decades building technology at scale, the work shifted from what systems could be built to which systems should be built—and how to ensure they endure responsibly.

## Hit Refresh: A Mindset Shift
By 2018, the arc of a technology career had traced a familiar pattern: telecommunications infrastructure, enterprise systems, platform ecosystems, cloud-scale services. Four decades. Fortune 100 companies. Startups. Successes and failures. Products that reached millions of users. Systems that scaled across continents.

**Satya Nadella** wrote about the need to "hit refresh"—to step back, reconsider assumptions, and approach familiar problems with renewed perspective. As the 2020s began, I found myself doing exactly that. Not retiring from technology, but fundamentally reconsidering my relationship to it.

The questions changed. Not what systems could be built, but which systems should be built. Not how to scale, but how to sustain. Not just technical capability, but responsibility for long-term consequences. The work that followed wasn't a departure from four decades of building. It was building with different constraints in mind—and recognizing that those constraints had been there all along.
## Finding Purpose Through Service

### MassChallenge: Mentoring What Comes Next

Texas brought a different rhythm. After years of shipping software on tight deadlines, the move created space to step back and ask what actually mattered. **MassChallenge** provided an answer: helping the next generation of founders avoid mistakes I'd made, understand trade-offs I'd learned slowly, and build with intention rather than just momentum.

From 2018 through 2020, I worked with early-stage startups navigating the gap between vision and viability. The work wasn't about my expertise—it was about listening carefully, asking questions that exposed hidden assumptions, and helping founders articulate what they were actually trying to solve. Some companies pivoted. Some shut down. A few found traction. What mattered was creating space for clearer thinking.

The mentorship continued but gradually wound down as other work emerged. What remained was the recognition that giving back wasn't separate from building—it was part of understanding what building responsibly required.

## Returning to Product Work

### Messaging Platforms and Migration Challenges

In late 2019, I joined **Charles Schwab** to lead the migration of their messaging infrastructure—chat and email services moving from legacy on-premises systems to a modern cloud-based platform. My approach: decompose the problem into a thin vertical slice (a technique I had learned at Microsoft, and honed at DS-IQ). Start with one channel—chat, not chat and email together. Migrate a few business units first. Test. Learn. Repeat.

This required understanding the database flow at a deep technical level—how chat sessions were stored, how metrics were aggregated, how reports were generated. Customer service teams needed to see the same dashboards, measure CSR performance the same way, trust that the numbers matched between old and new systems before cutting over.

The constraint that mattered most wasn't technical—it was trust. The migration succeeded because we treated validation and sequencing as first-class deliverables. Start small. Prove it works. Expand carefully. That discipline mattered more than the technology itself.

### AIOps and Operational Intelligence

From 2021 through mid-2023, I worked at **Zenoss** on their AIOps platform—systems that use AI and machine learning to manage IT operations at scale. The platform integrated monitoring across hybrid infrastructures, predicted issues before they became outages, and automated responses to reduce manual intervention.

The work centered on improving anomaly detection accuracy through a partnership with Google. We increased precision by 18 percent—not through algorithmic breakthroughs but by understanding which signals mattered and which created noise. We also reduced cloud costs by 25 percent by rightsizing infrastructure based on actual usage patterns rather than projected peaks.

What became clear was that operational intelligence wasn't about generating more data. It was about making fewer, better decisions based on understanding what the system was actually doing versus what we thought it should be doing.

## Platform Engineering Meets Sustainability

### Toyota: Cost, Carbon, and Developer Experience
In late 2023, I joined **Toyota Motor North America** (TMNA) to work on their internal developer platform called **CHOFER**. The mandate: reduce operational costs, improve developer productivity, and manage technical debt systematically.

The same discipline applied at Schwab worked here: decompose the problem, start with what could be measured, build visibility before demanding change. In a few months, we built the foundation to highlight technical debt across diverse product teams—organized by technology stacks, cloud resource utilization, business unit, and other key metrics. The platform provided visibility that hadn't existed before and established a roadmap for moving beyond proof-of-concept.

I left in April 2024 for personal reasons. But the work reinforced what decades of platform migrations had taught: the technical work is rarely the bottleneck. Aligning stakeholders, building trust in new systems, and establishing repeatable processes—that's where transformation succeeds or stalls.

## The Turn Toward Institutional Service

### NITK: Building Infrastructure That Endures
The connection to the **National Institute of Technology, Karnataka** began years before the formal work started. In 2018, the graduating class of 1981 held a reunion. We were the first batch to make a substantial collective contribution to the institute—not just a donation, but applied to specific projects. One initiative: establishing a plant on campus to convert food waste into biogas. The plant was successfully launched and is continuing to operate. That kept me connected.

When the time came to hit refresh in 2024, the choice was obvious. I formalized my "giving back" to NITK through a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the Warrier HEART Hub—a laboratory focused on AI and machine learning applications for sustainable campus operations. The Warrier name is a tribute to my parents, U.K. Warrier and Bhagyalakshmi Warrier. The H.E.A.R.T. framework provides the organizing principles: Human-centric design, Entrepreneurial spirit, Asset development, Regenerative resources, Technology innovation.

The work involves curriculum development, student mentoring, hackathons, and building partnerships with local industries and government bodies. Students aren't just learning about sustainable AI—they're building actual systems that solve problems in water management, waste streams, and energy efficiency for AI compute. The campus itself is a living lab for these projects.

What matters is institutional sustainability. The endowment structure ensures the centre's work continues beyond any single funding cycle. Training students and faculty ensures knowledge doesn't leave when individuals do. Building working systems on campus creates proof points that can be replicated elsewhere.

## What the 2020s Revealed

Platform thinking applies to more than software. The same principles that make technical systems sustainable—efficiency, resilience, transparency, long-term maintenance—apply to institutions, research programs, and how knowledge gets transferred across generations.

Cost optimization and environmental responsibility aren't separate goals. They're the same goal viewed through different lenses. Reducing waste, rightsizing resources, and designing for longevity all serve both.

Teaching matters as much as building. If knowledge stays with the people who built the system, the system becomes fragile when those people leave. Institutional memory is infrastructure.

And the hardest lesson: impact comes from choosing carefully, not building prolifically. After four decades, the question isn't "What else can I build?" It's "What actually needs to exist, and how do I help ensure it endures?"

The work continues—at NITK, through student mentorship, in research on sustainable AI systems. The tools change. The constraints evolve. But the underlying question remains: how do you build systems that serve people well, not just efficiently? And how do you ensure they keep serving people long after you're gone?

That's what the 2020s taught. That's what the work ahead requires.
