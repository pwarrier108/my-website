It is with a heavy heart and deep regret, that today I share the news of the recent passing of a remarkable individual—someone I was privileged to know and admire, Dr. TR Vishwanathan Thayamkulangara Viswanathan, or simply "TR." Today, I wish not only to mourn his departure but to celebrate a life well-lived, a life that left an indelible mark on the world of electrical engineering and beyond.

TR was more than a contemporary of luminaries such as Claude Shannon, Jack Kilby and Bob Metcalfe; he was a visionary in his own right. Taking his name from the town of Thyamkulamkara in Kerala, India, TR remained deeply connected to his roots throughout his illustrious career. A man of technological prowess and simplicity, he carried his heritage with pride and humility.

## Academic Journey

As a Professor of Electrical Engineering, Head of the Computer Centre, and Dean of Research and Development at IIT Kanpur, TR dedicated himself to the advancement of knowledge and the nurturing of young minds. His impact on the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Kanpur is immeasurable.

Beyond IIT Kanpur, TR's journey took him to the University of Waterloo, AT&T Bell Laboratories, the University of Pennsylvania, University of Michigan, Carnegie-Mellon, Texas Instruments, and eventually to the University of Texas in Austin. Even in retirement, he remained a Research Professor Emeritus at The University of Texas at Austin, holding the Silicon Laboratories Endowed Chair in Electrical Engineering.

## The Man Behind the Achievements

Despite his numerous achievements, TR rarely sought the limelight. His true passion lay in the success of his students and the joy of imparting knowledge. His students are thriving professionals spread throughout the tech centers in Austin, Bangalore, Silicon Valley, and more. As a family friend and mentor to me, he shared not only his engineering insights but also the richness of his family traditions. He spoke fondly of his roots, mentioning that his family used to be cooks by profession, creating a delightful analogy between integrated circuits and integrated idlis.

TR was not just an accomplished engineer; he was a noble soul. His humility and selflessness were evident in his wish to be born again as a tree, a symbol of selfless service to creation. Today, I salute TR on many levels, not only for his professional achievements but for being a valuable and fun-loving human being.

## A Spirit Forever Young

When he turned 80 a few years ago, he said, "I am only Hexadecimal 50," sharing his ever-young-at-heart spirit. Though we were separated by many years, I found myself drawn to his infectious outlook on life; whether it was food, performance cars like the Porsche Boxster he owned at one time, his fondness for music, pride in his Kerala heritage, and of course technology. He also helped me get through my toughest days in the world of startups.

## Farewell

As I bid farewell to this extraordinary individual, let us remember him for the lessons he imparted, the lives he touched, and the legacy he leaves behind. TR, you will be deeply missed, but your spirit and teachings will continue to inspire us all.

May his soul attain Sadgathi.
