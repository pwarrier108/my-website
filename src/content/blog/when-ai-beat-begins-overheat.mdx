We seem to be mesmerized by the rhythm of artificial intelligence. The speed of responses. The confidence of answers. The illusion of effortlessness.

But every beat has a temperature.

A recent analysis, [reported by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/), suggests that AI's carbon emissions by 2025 could rival the annual footprint of New York City. That comparison should give any system builder pause. Not because it is shocking, but because it is entirely plausible.

For much of computing history, we were sheltered by an invisible gift. Transistor density kept doubling, performance kept rising, and the energy cost per unit of work quietly fell in the background. Efficiency improved faster than ambition. We scaled, generation after generation, without ever really feeling the heat. Moore's Law carried the weight.

AI has changed that bargain.

## The Material Reality of Intelligence

Modern intelligence does not merely execute instructions. It is trained, refined, and sustained through vast cycles of computation—systems that draw power continuously, shed heat relentlessly, and depend on layers of infrastructure we rarely name. Electricity is only the most visible layer; beneath it sit cooling systems, materials, logistics, and industrial processes that quietly shape the footprint of every model. What we experience as "the cloud" is, in reality, grounded in concrete floors, cooling loops, and long supply chains.

At some point, the material consequences stop being background noise. Energy, heat, and environmental impact quietly move from the margins to the centre of the design.

We speak often about intelligence. We spend far less time on what it consumes.

## Intelligence Grounded in the World

If the beat of AI is beginning to overheat, the question is not whether we slow it down—but whether we learn to design intelligence that understands the world it depends on.

**Intelligence isn't abstract—it is grounded in the world.**
