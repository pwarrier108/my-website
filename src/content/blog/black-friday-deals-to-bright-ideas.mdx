As the holiday season approaches, the excitement of Black Friday is undeniable. For many, it's a day to snag the best gadgets, travel packages, and other deals. I used to be one of those people who would line up in the wee hours of the morning chasing door-buster specials (or the online versions). However, recently, I've discovered another way to spend this day—dedicating it to learning and personal growth.

Instead of diving into "retail therapy", I've made it a tradition to explore new subjects through online learning platforms. This habit has not only fueled my curiosity but also enriched both my personal and professional life. Three years ago, I began studying Sanskrit, an ancient language that captivates me. It is an ongoing, life-long journey that has offered profound insights into history, literature, and even the evolution of modern languages.

## Last Year: Generative AI Foundations

Last year, I ventured into the world of generative AI by enrolling in Maximilian Schwarzmüller's course, *ChatGPT—The Complete Guide to ChatGPT & OpenAI APIs*. This comprehensive program introduced me to foundational concepts of ChatGPT, advanced prompt engineering, and real-world applications of tools like Copilot, DALL-E, and MidJourney. These skills proved transformative, as I applied them to enhance my book, *Mantras for Product Managers*. Using MidJourney and Microsoft Designer, I created visually compelling images that brought a unique dimension to the content, showcasing the power of generative AI in creative projects.

## This Year: Advanced AI Techniques

This year, my journey continues with Ed Donner's *Mastering Generative AI and LLMs: An 8-Week Hands-On Journey*. The course dives into advanced AI techniques and provides practical, real-world experience with platforms like HuggingFace, LangChain, and Gradio. It covers cutting-edge concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), QLoRA fine-tuning, and the development of AI agents. What excites me most are the real-world projects, ranging from building multi-modal customer support assistants to creating knowledge workers that can navigate complex datasets. The practical applications align perfectly with a product idea I've been nurturing, and I look forward to using these learnings to bring it to life.

## Reimagining Black Friday

For me, Black Friday is no longer just a shopping event—it's a celebration of curiosity and growth. Each year, this tradition reminds me of the transformative power of continuous learning. It's a day to step away from the usual and invest in knowledge that has a lasting impact.

If you're looking for a new way to spend this Black Friday, consider diving into a subject that excites you or mastering a skill you've always wanted to learn. The growth opportunities are endless, and the rewards extend far beyond the moment. Let's reimagine Black Friday as a day to innovate, explore, and transform.

Happy learning!
