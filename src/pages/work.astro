        <h1>Work — Building at Scale</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Across four decades, the work has evolved from silicon-layer innovation to cloud-scale systems to sustainable AI. What remains constant: simplifying complexity, building bridges across organizations, and moving technology from potential to impact.

            <h2>The Arc of a Technology Career</h2>
            <p>The tools changed constantly but the questions remained: How do you build at scale without losing the human? What holds when the playbook doesn't exist? How do constraints breed better systems?</p>
            <p>This section documents decisions made under pressure, leadership lessons learned across industries, and entrepreneurial wisdom gained from both successes and failures. It is not a résumé—it is a record of thinking shaped by real constraints.</p>

            <h2>Career Phases</h2>
            
            <h3>1980s-90s: Telecommunications Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Building foundational systems in Australia during the shift from analog to digital. Working with constraints—limited bandwidth, high latency, physical distance—that forced elegance in design. Learning that infrastructure decisions ripple for decades.</p>
            
            <h3>2000s: Microsoft and Enterprise Scale</h3>
            <p>Product leadership at Microsoft during the cloud transition. Navigating massive organizational complexity, balancing innovation with backward compatibility, understanding what it means to serve enterprise customers whose systems must never fail.</p>
            
            <h3>2010s: Digital Analytics and Transformation</h3>
            <p>Leading analytics platforms, helping organizations make sense of data at scale. The challenge wasn't just technical—it was cultural. How do you help companies make better decisions when their incentives resist change?</p>
            
            <h3>2020s: Sustainable AI and Institution Building</h3>
            <p>Current focus on sustainable AI innovation, climate-resilient technologies, and building research capacity at NITK. The question now: How do we ensure AI systems serve humanity without destroying the environment that sustains us?</p>

        <section class="home-section mb-xl">
            <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Leadership is judgment under uncertainty. It is recognizing which fundamentals matter and which trends can be ignored. It is building systems that respect constraints rather than pretending they don't exist.</p>
            <p>Over time, I learned that the best leaders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make tradeoffs visible, not hidden</li>
                <li>Understand that "working" is not the same as "working well"</li>
                <li>Know when to move fast and when to move carefully</li>
                <li>Build bridges between engineering and business without reducing either</li>
                <li>Recognize that technical problems are rarely just technical</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="home-section mb-xl">
            <h2>Entrepreneurship and Failure</h2>
            <p>Not every venture succeeds. Some of the most valuable lessons came from initiatives that didn't work—not because the technology failed, but because timing was wrong, market fit was poor, or organizational alignment was impossible.</p>
            <p>Failure teaches what success cannot: the importance of product-market fit, the dangers of technical elegance divorced from user needs, and the reality that great engineering without distribution is just expensive research.</p>
            <p>These lessons shaped everything that came after.</p>

            <h2>What This Section Offers</h2>
            <p>Case studies from different eras, detailed analyses of technical decisions, leadership frameworks developed through practice, and honest reflections on what worked and what didn't.</p>
            <p>The goal is not to glorify experience but to make it useful—to show how decisions were made, what tradeoffs were accepted, and which values held under pressure.</p>
            <p>If you're building systems, leading teams, or trying to understand how technology evolves, this is where context lives.</p>
